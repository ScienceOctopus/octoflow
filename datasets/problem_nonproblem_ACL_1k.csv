"In fact , it was this availability of the generalization operation that suggested a simplified account of coordination facts in English now being used in GPSG -LSB- 15 -RSB- and in an extension of PATR-II -LSB- 81 . training time is increased because of the extra nested loop needed to calculate feature covariances",0
The accuracies are presented by the `` micro averaged '' F-score . an adaption to a different dialogue system or to new modalities is quite expensive,0

Thus probabilistic modeling of any data structures is possible when they are represented by feature forests . unobserved co-occurrences of words in the training corpus,0
This particular ordering of theories is based on the ordering of meanings of the corresponding words in dictionaries -LRB- derived and less frequent meanings have lower priority -RRB- . the word form of an unknown word often contains useful information that is not available in the present setup,0

Based on this information inter-chunk dependencies are computed using a special purpose parser which is sensitive to the type of chunks . the individuals’ propensity of alignment is only characterized using a proportion of lexical elements,0
This result further demonstrates the importance of obtaining an accurate lexicon in unsupervised training . it is not obvious that we have learned particularly useful clues about what differentiates the English written by authors with different native languages,0
"However , CART 's step-wise treatment of variables , optimization heuristics , and dependency on binary splits obscure the possible relationships that exist among the various factors . it does not take into account the semantic similarities between the words that are combined in the CDSM models",0
We divide key/response entity pairs into four categories : existence of nonadaptive sentences that may be inappropriate in some of the scenes,0

"To keep the construction 's original structure , the form pole can be modeled with the help of the realized-by property4 while the meaning pole is built via the edns : expresses property . the feature set , even with feature selection , may fit the labeled source data well but not the target data because the target data has no labels to be used in feature selection",0
"Furthermore , integrating the knowledge about multi-word expressions into the word alignment models is another future direction for this work . the system does not take into account constraints from mentions outside of the ( mention , antecedent ) pairs",0
"The rest of the preprocessing procedure was applied to all the datasets mentioned above , both parallel and monolingual . the parsing process might slow down the system significantly",0
In this paper we leverage the existing linear model -LRB- Equation 2 -RRB- to bring source-side context into phrase-based MT in a way that is robust to data sparseness . it gives poor results when the number of clusters is different from the real number of valid classes,0

"'' The police has arrived at the scene and is thoroughly investigating the cause of the accident . '' Overall , pruning works less effectively for nouns than for verbs . it may bring extra noises into our system",0
The translation literature also shows that translation requires non-isomorphic transformation from the source to the target . the sentences are artificially constructed for the LSAT and GRE tests,0
"For lemma and POS annotation , we can calculate basic agreement statistics , as there is one annotation for each token . the sensitivity of this method to the set of initial seeds ( Pantel et al. , 2009 )",0
The main ideas of the three-level semantics can be stated as follows : they make little or no direct use of syntactic information,0

"The queries used for system development and threshold tuning were created by the authors , while queries based on the set of event types in the ACE extraction evaluations were used for testing . the actual lexical information gets lost in favor of marking IGs , preventing the potential usage of that information in deciding on inter-word dependencies",0
This approach has however never been applied to large scale term extraction because it is based on a full semantic analysis of sentences . the complexity in syntactic processing is coupled with semantic parsing and makes the latter even harder,0
Brill and Resnik -LRB- 1994 -RRB- use Brill 's transformation-based algorithm along with simple counts within a lexical hierarchy in order to generalize over individual words . the exponential relationship between the number of possible paraphrases of a summary of a set of facts and the number of facts in that set,0
Executing a rule consequent can involve the assertion or retraction of facts to/from the KB . its cost : associating concept tags with a dialogue transcription is already a tedious task and its complexity is largely increased by the requirement for a precise delimitation of the support ( lexical segment ) corresponding to each tag,0
"Building on Alves and Gongalves -LRB- forthcoming -RRB- , we decided to count conceptual encodings as the sums of -LSB- l + p -RSB- because each instance of -LSB- p -RSB- includes at least one instance of conceptual encoding . semantically isolated senses ( identified as neighbors )",0
