211,,,"A shortcoming which is common to all of these approaches using a “percent correct” measurement to evaluate models of part-of-speech induction is that in assigning an induced word cluster to a known target category , such as noun , and evaluating the goodness of the cluster according to how well it represents the class noun , the assumption is made that it is fine for a target class to be represented by multiple induced clusters , but it is unacceptable for a single induced category to represent a combination of multiple target categories",,1,acl_cambridge
212,,,The technical challenge is that each level of correspondence ( character and morpheme ) can completely describe the observed data,,1,acl_cambridge

305,,,The main limitation is that the quality of the output is very susceptible to the quality and amount of resources available,,1,acl_cambridge
306,,,Another limitation of the proposed ( univariate ) analysis lies in the fact that it exclusively focuses on error types taken in isolation,,1,acl_cambridge
307,,,"The formalism presented by Kornai ( 1996 ) allows a significant reduction in the network size , but its main disadvantage lies in the fact that it significantly deviates from the standard methodology of developing finite-state devices , and integration of vectorized automata with standard ones remains a challenge",,1,acl_cambridge

310,,,"During this task , the problem of unknown word",,1,acl_cambridge
311,,,The other issue is that ONSET can also play a role for triggering resyllabification,,1,acl_cambridge
312,,,A major drawback of inducing normalization lexicons using most approaches described in Section 2 is that they are restricted to learning one-to-one word mappings,,1,acl_cambridge

320,,,One drawback of evaluating on a downstream task is that evaluation is typically slower compared to using an intrinsic metric,,1,acl_cambridge
321,,,"In short , one important shortcoming of existing large scale semantic grammars is that they do not assign semantically equivalent sentences the same semantic representation",,1,acl_cambridge
322,,,This would have the disadvantage of complicating the feature space,,1,acl_cambridge

328,,,"Thus , we can overcome effectively the problem of unobserved co-occurrences of words in the training corpus",,1,acl_cambridge
329,,,A more general shortcoming is that the word form of an unknown word often contains useful information that is not available in the present setup,,1,acl_cambridge
330,,,Fundamentally the problem is that very conservative approaches to exact and partial string matches overgenerate badly,,1,acl_cambridge
331,,,The shortcoming of this text representation is the increase of its size with the increase of the text or the n-gram length,,1,acl_cambridge

348,,,A major drawback is the low coverage of the lexicon,,1,acl_cambridge

350,,,"A drawback of computing each ai locally is that the system does not take into account constraints from mentions outside of the ( mention , antecedent ) pairs",,1,acl_cambridge
351,,,One drawback is that the parsing process might slow down the system significantly,,1,acl_cambridge
352,,,The main limitation of purity is that it gives poor results when the number of clusters is different from the real number of valid classes,,1,acl_cambridge
353,,,"One limitation is that these proposed tools rely on resources of limited coverage , such as dictionaries , thesauri , or manually constructed databases to generate the candidates",,1,acl_cambridge
354,,,Another limitation is that only five predefined realisations of REs were used to elicit object descriptions from the participants,,1,acl_cambridge
355,,,An additional drawback is that all existing systems can be used for analysis but not for generation,,1,acl_cambridge

361,,,"In spite of their success , a key limitation of phrase-based systems is that they make little or no direct use of syntactic information",,1,acl_cambridge
362,,,"The most obvious method would be to simply output the highest scoring word class , but this has the disadvantage of discarding much of the information present in the soft labeling",,1,acl_cambridge
363,,,We counter the problem of a large parameter space,,1,acl_cambridge
364,,,"The second issue is that there has been little consistency in the field in the use of cross-validation , the number of L1s , and which L1s are used",,1,acl_cambridge

381,,,"Although this method does not require the availability of English pronunciation , it has a serious limitation because it does not provide a mechanism for inserting the omitted short vowels in Arabic names",,1,acl_cambridge
382,,,"One shortcoming of this approach , for which the second evaluation seeks to compensate , is that a very small , and likely biased , subset of the policy sections is considered",,1,acl_cambridge
383,,,This function has the disadvantage that longer definitions are prefered over short ones,,1,acl_cambridge
384,,,"Continuing to focus on the materialised KB2 , we note another limitation of existing works : if only existential quantifiers are used then some objects are unidentifiable ( i.e. , it is not possible to distinguish them uniquely )",,1,acl_cambridge
385,,,A major challenge for neural network LMs is how to handle the words at the output layer since the softmax normalization would be very costly for large vocabularies,,1,acl_cambridge
386,,,One shortcoming of querying a search engine to obtain training pairs is it tends to be costly in terms of time and bandwidth,,1,acl_cambridge

388,,,The drawback is that the complexity in syntactic processing is coupled with semantic parsing and makes the latter even harder,,1,acl_cambridge
389,,,A difficulty to achieving this is the exponential relationship between the number of possible paraphrases of a summary of a set of facts and the number of facts in that set,,1,acl_cambridge
390,,,Obviously a major drawback of the approach is its cost : associating concept tags with a dialogue transcription is already a tedious task and its complexity is largely increased by the requirement for a precise delimitation of the support ( lexical segment ) corresponding to each tag,,1,acl_cambridge

401,,,The problem was that such probabilities could not be estimated directly from the data due to data sparseness,,1,acl_cambridge
402,,,The third limitation of the Levenshtein metric is that a deviation between two scanpaths in one fixation leads to an increase of the dissimilarity of 1 irrespective of whether the deviation is spatially large or small,,1,acl_cambridge
403,,,The only weakness of this strategy is its apparent inadequacy in dealing with the sparse data problem,,1,acl_cambridge
404,,,"An inherent difficulty of this approach for the reader is that we only get to see a small subset of the examples that the experimenter has collected and our view is controlled by the opinions of an analyst , who typically was not a participant to the conversation and who might not even have been present at the time",,1,acl_cambridge
