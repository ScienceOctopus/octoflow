0,,acl_cambridge,,"The difficulty with this task lies in the fact that prosodic cues are never absolute ; they are relative to individual speakers , gender , dialect , discourse context , local context , phonological environment , and many other factors",1,
1,,acl_cambridge,,The problem with rich annotations is that they increase the state space of the grammar substantially,1,
2,,acl_cambridge,,"As a consequence , when adapting existing methods and techniques to a new domain , researchers and users are faced with the problem of absence of annotated material that could be used for training",1,
3,,acl_cambridge,,The second problem of traditional word alignment approaches is the fact that parameter estimations are usually based on plain text items only,1,
4,,acl_cambridge,,The main drawback of these systems is that they fail to recognize terms which are not included in the dictionary,1,
5,,acl_cambridge,,"Although these approaches do not suffer from so-called label-bias problems ( Lafferty et al. , 2001 ) , one limitation is that they are inefficient to train with large-scale , especially large category data",1,
6,,acl_cambridge,,To overcome the disadvantage of measure word generation in a general SMT system,1,
7,,acl_cambridge,,"However , the problem is not totally solved because many verb reorderings are still missed",1,
8,,acl_cambridge,,"Furthermore , most pattern-based methods rely on term frequency , which have the limitation of finding infrequent but important product features",1,
9,,acl_cambridge,,This solution can avoid the problem of the expansion of CFG rules,1,
10,,acl_cambridge,,The main weakness of this method is that an SF error can be corrected only if the right SF appears at least in one of the n-best parse trees,1,
11,,acl_cambridge,,The only shortcoming is the cost of annotation,1,
12,,acl_cambridge,,"This fact in turn caused the problem of underrepresentation of Kazakh language in various fields such as science , entertainment , official documentation , etc .",1,
13,,acl_cambridge,,Perhaps the biggest limitation is the small number of research participants,1,
14,,acl_cambridge,,To cope with the problem of sparse training resources,1,
15,,acl_cambridge,,One probable disadvantage is that the scheme will be less general,1,
16,,acl_cambridge,,The latter approach has the potential weakness of unsupervised training erasing what was learned from the manually annotated corpus,1,
17,,acl_cambridge,,A notorious problem with computational linguistics is that there is no path into it,1,
18,,acl_cambridge,,"A serious problem in manual nugget creation is the inconsistency in human decisions ( Lin and Hovy , 2003 )",1,
19,,acl_cambridge,,We also address the issue of sparse or impoverished training data,1,
20,,acl_cambridge,,The limitation is that word vectors developed from distributional models cannot reveal word relatedness if its information does not lie in word distributions,1,
21,,acl_cambridge,,"While these algorithms usually achieve the best performance , as compared to their unsupervised or knowledge-based alternatives , there is an important shortcoming associated with these methods : their applicability is limited only to those words for which sense tagged data is available",1,
22,,acl_cambridge,,One drawback of this work is that depth-boundedness is undecidable,1,
23,,acl_cambridge,,This problem arises due to limited vowel presentation in this writing system,1,
24,,acl_cambridge,,What the author and her colleagues have done to avoid the problem of analyzer bias,1,
25,,acl_cambridge,,So the loss and distortion of semantic information,1,
26,,acl_cambridge,,The problem of data sparseness for PCFG,1,
27,,acl_cambridge,,A common problem for unsupervised models trained on verb-object tuples is that the objects can belong to more than one semantic class,1,
28,,acl_cambridge,,"Although there exist abundant collections of raw text , the high expense of manually annotating the text",1,
29,,acl_cambridge,,The main problem of non-lexicalized context-free grammars is that nonterminal symbols encode too general information which weakly discriminates syntactic ambiguities,1,
30,,acl_cambridge,,"HCDAE outperforms single DAE for high dimensional feature learning ( row 6 vs. 5 ; row 9 vs. 8 ; row 14 vs. 13 ; row 17 vs. 16 ) , and further improve the performance of DAE feature learning , which can also somewhat address the bring shortcoming of the limited input features",1,
31,,acl_cambridge,,"While this study introduces statistical measures to evaluate instance reliability , it remains vulnerable to data sparseness and has the limitation of taking into consideration only one-word terms",1,
32,,acl_cambridge,,"Our heuristics currently allow some such exceptions to be found , although they are by no means a complete solution to the problem of exceptions",1,
33,,acl_cambridge,,The challenge of this task is the much skewed distribution in real text,1,
34,,acl_cambridge,,"However , the main limitation of existing approaches is that they are ad-hoc : the rules that govern word formation and inflection are only implicit in such systems , usually intertwined with control structures and general code",1,
35,,acl_cambridge,,"While MERT does not scale to large numbers of features , the scarcity of manually aligned training data",1,
36,,acl_cambridge,,"A major drawback of this early work was that it used no lexical information in the supertagging process as the training material consisted of ( part-of-speech , supertag ) pairs",1,
37,,acl_cambridge,,"Despite of their success , a limitation of them is that their performances are easily affected by the size of the context window",1,
38,,acl_cambridge,,"Furthermore , one possible drawback in employing this bootstrapping method is that there may be a complementary distribution between prosodic and lexical features",1,
39,,acl_cambridge,,Its most obvious drawback is that the method can translate only those source language strings contained in the translation database,1,
40,,acl_cambridge,,"Apart from system delay , another current limitation that will influence future interactive speech systems is the unavailability of full prosodic analysis",1,
41,,acl_cambridge,,"A major weakness of many existing scoring engines such as the Intelligent Essay AssessorTM ( Landauer et al. , 2003 ) is that they adopt a holistic scoring scheme , which summarizes the quality of an essay with a single score and thus provides very limited feedback to the writer",1,
42,,acl_cambridge,,"The latter drawback is the more serious one : the metrics were not designed to evaluate single key/response pairs , but whole texts",1,
43,,acl_cambridge,,The disadvantage of this approach is that it involves a good deal of human effort to research on a specific data set and summarize the rules,1,
44,,acl_cambridge,,The most significant drawback is that ontologies are not standard among systems,1,
45,,acl_cambridge,,"The limitation of locating parts of arguments , such as the positions and head words , is that it is only a partial solution to argument labeling in discourse parsing",1,
46,,acl_cambridge,,The only drawback or risk of this strategy is that some of the system timex-values could be incorrect,1,
47,,acl_cambridge,,"However , the WCN does not assign probability to the u = fi* case –",1,
48,,acl_cambridge,,The primary weakness of this approach is that it relies too heavily on user interaction,1,
49,,acl_cambridge,,Our solution to the problem of lone prepositions,1,
50,,acl_cambridge,,One shortcoming of the dual decomposition approach is that it only applies to parse-scoring functions with an arc-factored component,1,
51,,acl_cambridge,,One disadvantage of the model above is that it is not capable of modeling bilexical dependencies on the right hand side of the rules,1,
52,,acl_cambridge,,Another issue with the linear representation of ECs is that crucial dependencies between ECs and other elements in the syntactic structure are not represented,1,
53,,acl_cambridge,,"The main drawback is that it needs almost 20,000 iterations before the Gibbs sampler converges",1,
54,,acl_cambridge,,One drawback is that it cannot deal with dependencies of higher order of TU n-grams than bigrams,1,
55,,acl_cambridge,,Another limitation that may have affected the accuracy of the model was the way in which potential predictor variables were refined,1,
56,,acl_cambridge,,A disadvantage of the weasel tag is its short life span,1,
57,,acl_cambridge,,The disadvantage is that it is likely to worsen the generalising power of the model,1,
58,,acl_cambridge,,"While this retains the coherence of the model , the restriction to pairwise predicates",1,
59,,acl_cambridge,,"A drawback to using XPath to query a hierarchy which is serialised to multiple annotation files , is that much of the efficiency of XPath expressions can be lost through the necessity of resolving XLinks at every child or parent step of the expression",1,
60,,acl_cambridge,,"In exchange , a limitation of our pre-editing approach is that it is language-dependent , as the underlying technology is based on shallow analysis and is therefore timeexpensive to extend to a new language",1,
61,,acl_cambridge,,Intervals have a very obvious weakness in that the highly precise choice of endpoints can rarely be wellmotivated in natural domains such as these,1,
62,,acl_cambridge,,"The main limitation of the two models discussed above is that they take the bag-of-words ( BOW ) assumption without considering the fact that an email thread is a multi-party , asynchronous conversation",1,
63,,acl_cambridge,,A further difficulty in creating the transformation is that the head passing conventions differ between DepBank and CCGbank,1,
64,,acl_cambridge,,"First , as maximum margin classifiers , they sidestep the common issue of overfitting",1,
65,,acl_cambridge,,A potential drawback is that it might not work well for low-frequency words,1,
66,,acl_cambridge,,A difficulty in comparing approaches to tweet normalization is the sparsity of publicly available datasets,1,
67,,acl_cambridge,,All references Sentence Error Rate ( aSER ) : The SER metric presents the drawback of working with only one reference,1,
68,,acl_cambridge,,"One drawback of his algorithm is that it requires the proportion of positive and negative examples in the test data be close to the proportion in the training data , which may not always hold , particularly when the training data is small",1,
69,,acl_cambridge,,Its major limitation is that it can only handle approximately 20 words or phrases,1,
70,,acl_cambridge,,"A major weakness of many existing essay scoring engines such as IntelliMetric ( Elliot , 2001 ) and Intelligent Essay Assessor ( Landauer et al. , 2003 ) is that they adopt a holistic scoring scheme , which summarizes the quality of an essay with a single score and thus provides very limited feedback to the writer",1,
71,,acl_cambridge,,The main limitation is that E1 and E2 regularization can not let the model give weight to conjunctions that have not been observed at training,1,
72,,acl_cambridge,,A serious limitation of the current implementation is the fact that the configurability of PRESENTOR at the micro-planning level is restricted to the lexicalization and the linguistic realization of rhetorical relations,1,
73,,acl_cambridge,,It is obvious that this dual question of true or false invokes the issue of vagueness,1,
74,,acl_cambridge,,The primary disadvantages of navigating menus for users are the difficulty of matching their goals to the given options,1,
75,,acl_cambridge,,"The drawback is that , since extracted events in test are imperfect , this creates a divergence between training and testing scenarios , which can lead to degraded performance",1,
76,,acl_cambridge,,A common limitation is that the user may not find the exact sign ( or version of a sign ) that is needed for a particular sentence,1,
77,,acl_cambridge,,Another shortcoming is that these models have not been scrutinized using standard NLP evaluations,1,
78,,acl_cambridge,,"However , the shortcoming of both approaches is that they ignore edge type information",1,
79,,acl_cambridge,,"Of course , a fundamental problem in evaluating NLG is that there may be many acceptable outputs",1,
80,,acl_cambridge,,The main problem with a voting technique is that it does not effectively combine competing factors into a single model,1,
81,,acl_cambridge,,A severe limitation of the current TED system is its restricted range of syntactic coverage,1,
82,,acl_cambridge,,"The drawback of this move is that when two entities belonging to the same class are adjacent , our classifier will automatically merge them into one entity",1,
83,,acl_cambridge,,A limitation of our system in its current version lies in the requirement for absolute lexical match with unknown rule unigrams and bigrams,1,
84,,acl_cambridge,,"Although it is very efficient in terms of translation speed , it suffers from the drawback of being dependent on the so-called monotonicity constraint : The alignment paths are assumed to be monotone",1,
85,,acl_cambridge,,These analyses have crucially solved the problem of tree overgeneration,1,
86,,acl_cambridge,,One limitation is that we have been using the same set of features for all concepts,1,
87,,acl_cambridge,,One limitation of the proposed modeling approach is the arc-based features,1,
88,,acl_cambridge,,This problem of circularity in expert coding,1,
89,,acl_cambridge,,"A large drawback of SMT systems is that they use no or little grammatical knowledge , relying mainly on a target language model for producing correct target language texts , often resulting in ungrammatical output",1,
90,,acl_cambridge,,The main drawback is that the entries produced automatically need some semimanual checking,1,
91,,acl_cambridge,,A main shortcoming of using ROUGE-1 is that the generated sentences are compared only to a finite set of human labeled ground truth which obviously does not capture all possible sentences that one can generate,1,
92,,acl_cambridge,,"However , a more fundamental difficulty is that many of the textual characteristics which are problematic for a pipeline to generate are also difficult to measure computationally",1,
93,,acl_cambridge,,Thereby denying the common knowledge that the drawback of using gold standard evaluations is the fact that gold standards often prove to be incomplete,1,
94,,acl_cambridge,,Two types of solutions have been proposed for the problem of low agreement on sense tagging,1,
95,,acl_cambridge,,The major drawback of using bi-lexical representations is that it limits us to using a single source language,1,
96,,acl_cambridge,,"The only drawback we observed with SVM2 was that it seemed to be quite weak for the very low frequency classes such as RNA , SOURCE.mo or TIME where the Ell\ilM usually proved to be more robust",1,

98,,acl_cambridge,,One shortcoming of LCSeg is that it ignores speaker information when segmenting transcripts,1,
99,,acl_cambridge,,"From an NLP perspective , the problem of the ambiguity of the clitic pronoun se",1,
100,,acl_cambridge,,The major drawback of these approaches is their dependency on seed examples or seed patterns which may lead to limited generalization due to dependency on handcrafted examples,1,
101,,acl_cambridge,,"A major problem with machine translation , regardless of the translation method , is that performance drops rapidly as input sentences become longer",1,
102,,acl_cambridge,,"In our setup , the one possible shortcoming of our approach to constructing reference sets for translation sense clustering is that a cluster may correspond to a sense that is not shared by the original source word used to generate the translation set",1,
103,,acl_cambridge,,An obvious drawback is that it is necessary to re-classify many words if the application domain changes significantly,1,
104,,acl_cambridge,,A key challenge in this task is sparsity of labeled data : a given predicate-role instance may only occur a handful of times in the training set,1,
105,,acl_cambridge,,One problem with evaluating a spell checker designed to correct search queries is that evaluation data is hard to get,1,
106,,acl_cambridge,,This mechanism has the disadvantage that it involves high overhead,1,
107,,acl_cambridge,,"The drawback of this approach was the need to manage text distribution among the annotators , as all the work was done on local computers",1,
108,,acl_cambridge,,"Its disadvantage is that sense disambiguation is not carried out relative to any well defined set of senses , but rather an ad hoc set",1,
109,,acl_cambridge,,The only drawback is that it willperform slower as it needs to process all the words,1,
110,,acl_cambridge,,A shortcoming of these kinds of automatic generators is that users have to be patient to find the name that they are looking for,1,
111,,acl_cambridge,,But the drawback noticed in this research is that need of extensive syntactic resources to determine the knowledge to be acquired,1,
112,,acl_cambridge,,"A weakness of the method is that poor results are obtained for language pairs that are not closely related ( Ismail and Manandhar , 2010 )",1,
113,,acl_cambridge,,The second limitation is that the dataset contains only those acronyms whose long-forms were found in Medline abstracts,1,
114,,acl_cambridge,,"The major limitation of these works is the use of EUROVOC , which is a specific resource workable only for European languages",1,
115,,acl_cambridge,,"Nevertheless , it is well-known that k-means has the major drawback of not being able to separate data points",1,
116,,acl_cambridge,,"However , as observed by Liben-Nowell and Kleinberg ( 2003 ) , hitting time has the drawback of being sensitive to portions of the graph that are far from the start node because it considers paths of length up to oc",1,
117,,acl_cambridge,,"However , a significant drawback of this approach is that PEM requires substantial in-domain bilingual data to train the semantic adequacy evaluator , as well as sample human judgments to train the overall metric",1,
118,,acl_cambridge,,The main contribution of this paper is putting forward an approach which can make up for the limitation of using the statistical model or human knowledge purely by combining them organically,1,
119,,acl_cambridge,,The drawback is that the estimates of parameters corresponding to events that occur infrequently in the training data are not reliable,1,
120,,acl_cambridge,,"Hence , they are not long and most of them do not exhibit interesting linguistic properties",1,
121,,acl_cambridge,,"But the limitation is that it required a dependency parser , thesaurus , and training data",1,
122,,acl_cambridge,,"In testing a retrieval-based system , although we can simply use the original responses associated with the query post as positive and treat all the others as negative , this strategy suffers from the problem of spurious negative examples",1,
123,,acl_cambridge,,A well-known problem of Statistical Machine Translation ( SMT ) is that performance quickly degrades as soon as testing conditions deviate from training conditions,1,
124,,acl_cambridge,,We have found that the problem of combinatorial explosion in parsing English,1,
125,,acl_cambridge,,"In general , the formalism must be able to deal with , discontinuous constituents , a problem not dissimilar to the problems of discontinuous constituents in natural language parsing",1,
126,,acl_cambridge,,Another limitation is that the research was conducted using a single system,1,
127,,acl_cambridge,,"The main drawback of applying this technique in dialectometry is that it is not directly related to the aggregate analysis , but is rather an independent step",1,
128,,acl_cambridge,,A drawback of learning by using complex functions is that complex functions do not generalize well and thus tend to over-fit,1,
129,,acl_cambridge,,One drawback of the reranking approach is that correct SF for the predicates of a sentence can actually appear in different parse trees,1,
130,,acl_cambridge,,"One possible drawback is that senses which one might want to keep separate , e.g. , the most common sense box/container ( 1 ) , can be collapsed with others",1,
131,,acl_cambridge,,One limitation of this model is its dependence on semantic resources,1,
132,,acl_cambridge,,The problem with these representation forms is that they are static,1,
133,,acl_cambridge,,"Note that this synthetic problem is considerably easier than a real MT scenario , where the gold scoring function is nonlinear",1,
134,,acl_cambridge,,"One shortcoming was that our classifier was effective only Exp.Conj , Exp.Inst and Exp.Rest",1,
135,,acl_cambridge,,"In the case of Japanese text processing , the most serious problem is poor accuracy of word segmentation and POS tagging",1,
136,,acl_cambridge,,Another drawback of the duplication is that the representation consumes more storage space than necessary,1,
137,,acl_cambridge,,The problem with this approach is that creating these rules requires much cost and that they are usually domain-dependent,1,
138,,acl_cambridge,,One possible disadvantage of this supervised approach is a loss of recall on unseen paraphrases,1,
139,,acl_cambridge,,"A main drawback to this model is that it weighs all co-occurrences equally , even those that happen rarely or never",1,
140,,acl_cambridge,,"One such limitation is the summarization of multimodal documents : no existing system is able to incorporate the non-text portions of a document ( e.g. , information graphics , images ) into the overall summary",1,
141,,acl_cambridge,,"Because such a semantics can be automically induced , it escapes the limitation of depending on relations from hand-built training data , knowledge bases or ontologies",1,
142,,acl_cambridge,,Another limitation is that these models are restricted to reorderings with no gaps and phrases that are adjacent,1,
143,,acl_cambridge,,"However , a potential shortcoming of this model is that it can not represent the link between arguments of a verb",1,
144,,acl_cambridge,,A major shortcoming is that the increase of coverage does not follow the growth of the case base to the same extent,1,
145,,acl_cambridge,,"The reason may lie in the training strategy , where we used sampling to solve the problem of unbalanced dataset",1,
146,,acl_cambridge,,"First , we note that a big weakness is that the system currently only works for Wikipedia pages",1,
147,,acl_cambridge,,"One problem with using some of the above criteria is that they are all negative tests , which are known to be problematic in language classification tasks",1,
148,,acl_cambridge,,"While M1 and M2 do not improve on the baseline , an important drawback of these baselines is that they may map two or more roles in an event description to the same dependency",1,
149,,acl_cambridge,,"While these models are well suited for the effective handling of highly divergent sentential word orders , the above frameworks have a limitation shared with probabilistic context free grammars that the preferred ordering of subtrees is insufficiently constrained by their embedding context",1,
150,,acl_cambridge,,Sadat and Habash ( 2006 ) address the issue of lexical sparsity,1,
151,,acl_cambridge,,"Their major drawback is that they require a great deal of skilled hand-crafting that , unfortunately , usually does not scale in broader application domains",1,
152,,acl_cambridge,,The first drawback is that it requires more knowledge of the user than using a more specialized one,1,
153,,acl_cambridge,,"The only drawback is , that we are confronted , again , with a syntactic feature containing , among other things , records of derivation history",1,
154,,acl_cambridge,,"A major shortcoming of using CUG or PATR-II as a linguistic formalism is that the dependencies that are necessary for determining anaphoric relationships are "" hidden "" in the DAG describing the linguistic expression ; information is distributed in a flat graph structure with no higher order grouping expressed",1,
155,,acl_cambridge,,This approach has the drawback of biasing somewhat the frequencies in our data set towards the categories that take precedence,1,
156,,acl_cambridge,,"Another drawback is that it is impossible to adapt them to a specific task , which could generate many errors that are important to the task",1,
157,,acl_cambridge,,"As also suggested in ( Pradhan et al. , 2008 ) , the major drawback is the poor generalization power affecting lexical features",1,
158,,acl_cambridge,,Another limitation is that it is hard to obtain data big enough to split the data into subparts for both the hierarchical mixed model analysis and classification,1,
159,,acl_cambridge,,"Further , a current practical limitation is that the SD scheme was developed against newswire data , namely the Wall Street Journal portion of the Penn Treebank",1,
160,,acl_cambridge,,"One limitation is the availability of annotated corpora , which do not exist for all languages",1,
161,,acl_cambridge,,The main drawback of the Perceptron style algorithm is that it does not have a mechanism for attaining the maximize margin of the training data,1,
162,,acl_cambridge,,"A related limitation is that its model of the speaker 's goals is static , rather than dynamic ( e.g. , the speaker is always assumed to have a goal of being polite )",1,
163,,acl_cambridge,,This proposal has the drawback of being quite costly,1,
164,,acl_cambridge,,We will focus in this paper on one kind of weakness of such parser which is their inability to properly take into account subcategorization frames ( SF ) of predicative lexemes2,1,
165,,acl_cambridge,,"However , one disadvantage is that the reliability of the rules is often language pair dependent",1,
166,,acl_cambridge,,"A further issue is that Docent is non-deterministic , i.e. , it can give different results with the same parameter weights",1,
167,,acl_cambridge,,Another shortcoming is that the database does not provide “true” recall,1,
168,,acl_cambridge,,One obvious shortcoming is that some information gets lost in the thresholding that converts posterior probabilities from the prosodic model and the auxiliary LM into binary features,1,
169,,acl_cambridge,,"However , its limitation is that the distance measure does not capture sufficient information of semantic relations between language constituents",1,
170,,acl_cambridge,,A deep syntax language model comes with the obvious disadvantage that any data it is trained on must be in-coverage of the parser,1,
171,,acl_cambridge,,"The other important criterion is the ability to read Kazakh , since not all of the interviewees could read in Kazakh sufficiently fluent",1,
172,,acl_cambridge,,A shortcoming of these kinds of automatic generators is that random generation can output so many bad suggestions and users have to be patient to find the name that they are looking for,1,
173,,acl_cambridge,,A further issue faced by these models is that the resources they rely on require significant effort to create and will not always be available to model data in a new language or a new domain,1,
174,,acl_cambridge,,The drawback shared by most statistical answer extractors is their reliance on predefined ontologies,1,
175,,acl_cambridge,,The drawback is that the solution may be only a local optimum,1,
176,,acl_cambridge,,"However , a drawback to the on-line algorithm is that a variant of Kipps ' caching cannot be used",1,
177,,acl_cambridge,,A more troubling problem is the instability of the model,1,
178,,acl_cambridge,,"We must hence accept the intrinsic limitation of using a bias whose source is the introspection of a single , or of a community of scientists",1,
179,,acl_cambridge,,The primary disadvantage of these models is that scores -- and as a result any feature representations -- are restricted to a single arc or a small number of arcs in the graph,1,
180,,acl_cambridge,,A shortcoming is that LDA does not modelize at all the sequentiality of the data,1,
181,,acl_cambridge,,The disadvantage of using such features is that this reduces the efficiency of the dynamic programming,1,
182,,acl_cambridge,,"In fact , the drawback of Paragraph Vector is that an iterative inference step is needed during runtime",1,
183,,acl_cambridge,,"Compared with the traditional approaches which utilize the first pass translation hypotheses , cross-lingual data selection model avoids the problem of noisy proliferation",1,
184,,acl_cambridge,,The potential drawback of using Equations 8 and 9 is that the CCG labels for a particular sentence significantly reduces the paraphrases that can be used,1,
185,,acl_cambridge,,"We do not include results for the BOOKS domain because the text collection is much larger than the other domains , and the computation for the MSZ relevance score ranking is intractable due to the number of n-grams",1,
186,,acl_cambridge,,"Overall , the relatively low performance of resolution",1,
187,,acl_cambridge,,But we also believe that ultimately this issue of annotator bias,1,
188,,acl_cambridge,,The drawback is the complexity it introduces into an ( up till now ) quite simple story,1,
189,,acl_cambridge,,This issue of annotator bias,1,
190,,acl_cambridge,,We can see here that the problem of the circularity of language comprehension,1,
191,,acl_cambridge,,"And the shell contains a system for evaluating parses , extending IIeidorn 's ( 1982 ) parse metric , which is used not only for ranking final parses but also for pruning away unlikely partial analyses during parsing , thus reducing the problem of parse space explosion",1,
192,,acl_cambridge,,The main drawback is that structures may not be properly represented by flat features,1,
193,,acl_cambridge,,The main drawback associated with this kind of user feedback is that the user may have to read a large number of reviews in order to make a decision,1,
194,,acl_cambridge,,"While they provide some efficiency gains , they do not help with the main problem of longer sentences",1,
195,,acl_cambridge,,"One limitation of using the CLE algorithm for generation is that the resulting tree , though maximal in probability , may not conform to basic linguistic properties of a dependency tree",1,
196,,acl_cambridge,,"However , the problem of exponential explosion",1,
197,,acl_cambridge,,"Another common drawback concerns the way most of the recent approaches perform their analysis : the various languages are analyzed independently of each other ( possibly by exploiting external knowledge like Wikipedia to enrich documents ( Kumar et al. , 2011c ; Kumar et al. , 2011a ) ) , and then the language-specific results are merged",1,
198,,acl_cambridge,,"Another important problem of most of these approximations is that they usually work with terms , and so disregard the contextual meaning of those terms in the sentence ( Martineau and Finin , 2009 ; Moilanen and Pulman , 2007 )",1,
199,,acl_cambridge,,One critical drawback of Collocation map is the time complexity,1,
200,,acl_cambridge,,"A drawback of their method is , however , that manual linguistic mark-up is not based on abstract rules but rather on individual linguistic intuition",1,
201,,acl_cambridge,,"An issue with the minimal binarizations is that the algorithm for finding them has a high computational complexity , and has not been evaluated empirically on treebank data.",1,
202,,acl_cambridge,,Another major drawback is that it requires considerable linguistic skill to produce proper rules in a proper order,1,
203,,acl_cambridge,,"In future , we plan to perform additional experiments to study the issue of noisy data",1,
204,,acl_cambridge,,There are two main ( not unrelated ) disadvantages to word similarity based approaches : 1. word co-occurrence information is not sufficiently exploited,1,
205,,acl_cambridge,,The major drawback is that we have to generate a list of all possible light verbs,1,
206,,acl_cambridge,,"The problem with these metrics is that they strongly depend on the arbitrarily defined window size parameter and do not penalize all error types equally , e.g. , pk penalizes false negatives more than false positives and wd penalizes false positive and negative boundaries more at the beginning and end of the text ( Lamprier , et al. , 2007 )",1,
207,,acl_cambridge,,A disadvantage of TNF is that it re-attaches a single node in every iteration,1,
208,,acl_cambridge,,One major time and cost limitation in developing LVCSR systems in Indian languages is the need for large training data,1,
209,,acl_cambridge,,"While such an analysis surely yields the most reliable links , it has the drawback of ignoring many links that might reflect true – although less frequently attested – conceptual relations",1,
210,,acl_cambridge,,"The main difficulty with the model is that because constraints on pronominal anaphora are stated entirely in terms of configurational relations of tree geometry , specifically , in terms of c-command and minimal dominating S and NP domains , control and unbounded dependency structures can only be handled by additional and fairly complex devices",1,
211,,acl_cambridge,,"A shortcoming which is common to all of these approaches using a “percent correct” measurement to evaluate models of part-of-speech induction is that in assigning an induced word cluster to a known target category , such as noun , and evaluating the goodness of the cluster according to how well it represents the class noun , the assumption is made that it is fine for a target class to be represented by multiple induced clusters , but it is unacceptable for a single induced category to represent a combination of multiple target categories",1,
212,,acl_cambridge,,The technical challenge is that each level of correspondence ( character and morpheme ) can completely describe the observed data,1,
213,,acl_cambridge,,Another limitation is that taxonomies are built according to the sense distinctions present in dictionaries and not according to the actual use of words in the corpus,1,
214,,acl_cambridge,,"One shortcoming of our current approach is that we focus mostly on unitary sources of overgeneration : a single lexical item , tree property or derivation operation that consistently occurs in overgenerated strings",1,
215,,acl_cambridge,,"The first problem is that Mongolian uses the Cyrillic alphabet to represent both conventional words and loanwords , and so the automatic extraction of loanwords is difficult",1,
216,,acl_cambridge,,"While voice selection mode allows the presenter greater mobility , it has the drawback of allowing the audience to see thumbnails of every slide returned by a content-based query , regardless of whether the presenter intended for them to be seen",1,
217,,acl_cambridge,,"The weakness of this is that it completely ignores the labeled source data after initialization , but the source data does contain some valuable information",1,
218,,acl_cambridge,,Another limitation of the proposed survival ratio based methods is that they work better on few articles which were highly modified by editors,1,
219,,acl_cambridge,,The main challenge for an experiment setup as described here is the considerable delay between user input and wizard response,1,
220,,acl_cambridge,,The second problem of overgeneration,1,
221,,acl_cambridge,,A fundamental limitation of the CCM is that it contains a single isolated parameter for every span,1,
222,,acl_cambridge,,Perhaps the most serious limitation is that they cannot be used to study language in natural tasks with real-world referents,1,
223,,acl_cambridge,,The second drawback is inherent to the way ROVER is usually run : the fusion process is typically fed with transcriptions of entire audio recordings ( lasting up to hours ),1,
224,,acl_cambridge,,The drawback is that this context may not be sufficient,1,
225,,acl_cambridge,,"Another shortcoming of this chapter is that nothing is said specifically about obtaining data from such resources as Twitter or Facebook , which need access via APIs rather than direct crawling",1,
226,,acl_cambridge,,A major challenge for such a joint system is the large search space faced by the decoder,1,
227,,acl_cambridge,,The major limitation of supervised approaches is that they require meaning annotations for example sentences,1,
228,,acl_cambridge,,"The first problem is the polysemy of relation phrases , which means that a relation phrase ctx can express different relations in different triples",1,
229,,acl_cambridge,,"Although our original aim was to develop a probabilistic framework that exploits Levin’s ( 1993 ) linguistic classification and the systematic correspondence between syntax and semantics , a limitation of the model is that it can not infer class information for verbs not listed in Levin",1,
230,,acl_cambridge,,The drawback is that this is expensive,1,
231,,acl_cambridge,,"Nevertheless , this approach has a drawback of over-generating ungrammatical sentences due to its “almost-free” alignment",1,
232,,acl_cambridge,,Another shortcoming is the treatment of input elements as indivisible entities,1,
233,,acl_cambridge,,This measure also has the disadvantage that it can miss the kind of conditioning information present in local subtrees,1,
234,,acl_cambridge,,"The first limitation is , all MFbased methods map words and their context words to two different sets of embeddings , and then employ Singular Value Decomposition ( SVD ) to obtain a low rank approximation of the word-context matrix M",1,
235,,acl_cambridge,,A current limitation is that we do not identify multiple target expressions for the same category,1,
236,,acl_cambridge,,But the problem of inaccurate constraint estimation,1,
237,,acl_cambridge,,"However , it does not provide a way to overcome the problem of inaccurate counts for low-probability cooccurrences",1,
238,,acl_cambridge,,"However , in the citations dataset , where a citing sentence may cover no information about the cited paper , randomization has the drawback of selecting citations that have no valuable information in them",1,
239,,acl_cambridge,,Their main drawback is that they may or may not produce the term types and granularities useful to the user,1,
240,,acl_cambridge,,"However , one shortcoming of existing parsers is that as the complexity of the sentences recognized increases , the computational complexity increases quadratically",1,
241,,acl_cambridge,,Another drawback is that the different sentence lengths have not been taken into account,1,
242,,acl_cambridge,,"A drawback of CNN as a classifier is that it finds only a local optimum , since it uses the same backpropagation technique as MLP",1,
243,,acl_cambridge,,The drawback is that the solution may be only a local optimum,1,
244,,acl_cambridge,,"However , an important drawback is that the tail model assigns a static preference to paraphrase ( i.e. , tail preferences are assumed to be contextindependent )",1,
245,,acl_cambridge,,Another serious problem with the handcrafted approach is that systems are hard to be ported across different domains and different languages,1,
246,,acl_cambridge,,A major limitation of this correction was the fact that misspellings resulting in real words were not addressed,1,
247,,acl_cambridge,,A limitation of the primitive weighting function described in Equation 1 is that it can not bridge vocabulary gaps between documents and queries,1,
248,,acl_cambridge,,A serious limitation of both π and κ is that all disagreements are treated equally,1,
249,,acl_cambridge,,The disadvantage of this method consists in the system having an unrealistically high memory requirement,1,
250,,acl_cambridge,,"A further difficulty is that languages are named , without the corresponding ISO language codes",1,
251,,acl_cambridge,,"One current limitation is that using only those arg2s that exactly match clean lists leaves out some good data ( e.g. , a tuple with an arg2 of ‘Univ of Wash’ will not match against a list of universities that spells it as ‘University of Washington’ )",1,
252,,acl_cambridge,,"A drawback is that their method limits the training of multi-sense embeddings to the M most common words , forcing a complete re-training of the model should a new word of interest appear",1,
253,,acl_cambridge,,One possible difficulty in using this automated procedure is that some synonyms for a word do not carry the same sentiment orientation,1,
254,,acl_cambridge,,Another limitation is that the generated summaries do not contain any information about the distribution of opinions,1,
255,,acl_cambridge,,"The limitation is that the choice of the appropriate conceptual types is non trivial , even when selecting very high-level tags",1,
256,,acl_cambridge,,"The drawback was that morphotactics was explicitly raised to the level of the sentence grammar , hence the categorial lexicon accounted for both constituent order and the morpheme order with no distinction",1,
257,,acl_cambridge,,We can eliminate the morphology to alleviate the problem of the data scarcity,1,
258,,acl_cambridge,,The only problem with this solution is that it will add complexity,1,
259,,acl_cambridge,,The second significant shortcoming which surfaces among ParaMor’s 41 final scheme clusters is that ParaMor currently does not address morphophonology,1,
260,,acl_cambridge,,"For those not covered cases , the problem is mainly due to incomplete sentences and wrong grammars",1,
261,,acl_cambridge,,A drawback is that these features give no information about where in the string the n-grams should occur,1,
262,,acl_cambridge,,"One obstacle is that we do not currently use subcategorization dictionaries for either language , while we have several for English",1,
263,,acl_cambridge,,"A major limitation of mapping natural language to OWL-DL is that the assertion component of the latter is essentially limited to atomic predications and their negations , so that ordinary statements such as Most students who passed the AI exam also passed the theory exam , or If Kim and Sandy get divorced , then Kim will probably get custody of their children , cannot be represented , let alone reasoned with",1,
264,,acl_cambridge,,"Moreover , a shortcoming of occurrence-based methods of polysemy resolution is that a given term may be assigned to an implausibly large number of categories",1,
265,,acl_cambridge,,One potential limitation of using only similarity features to represent a text pair is that of low representation power,1,
266,,acl_cambridge,,A drawback of our method is that it increases the size of the synchronous context-free grammar massively,1,
267,,acl_cambridge,,The major problem of this approach is data sparseness,1,
268,,acl_cambridge,,A remaining problem is that no studies could provide empirical comparisons across grammar theories,1,
269,,acl_cambridge,,The third limitation is that the sequential models treat queries as unstructured ( linear ) sequences of words,1,
270,,acl_cambridge,,The disadvantage is that many synonyms need to be discarded in order to achieve this property,1,
271,,acl_cambridge,,And another shortcoming is that a small number of words in almost every resulting class does n't belong to the part-of-speech categories which most of words in that class belong to,1,
272,,acl_cambridge,,A possible problem with this method is in the approximation of exponentially many parse trees by a polynomial-size sample,1,
273,,acl_cambridge,,"The main drawback to modeling p ( t Is ) in terms of p ( w I h , s ) is that the latter distribution is conditioned on two very disparate sources of information which are difficult to combine in a complementary way",1,
274,,acl_cambridge,,"However , a fundamental problem with this system is that it does not guarantee that the output parse is a projective dependency tree , only a projective dependency forest , that is , a sequence of adjacent , non-overlapping projective trees ( Nivre 2008 )",1,
275,,acl_cambridge,,"Furthermore , A disadvantage of this method is that the web mining process is quite inefficient",1,
276,,acl_cambridge,,Another more subtle shortcoming is the use of the raw empirical unigram distribution to represent content significance,1,
277,,acl_cambridge,,One serious drawback with existing subtitles is that they do not store meta-information about the speaker,1,
278,,acl_cambridge,,"Second , we avoid the problem of the combinatorial expansion in the search space",1,
279,,acl_cambridge,,"The main limitation of querying CGI scripts is that if the web site being queried is modified by its creators , slight modifications will have to be made to the query generator to accommodate those changes",1,
280,,acl_cambridge,,"However , the shortcoming is it relies too much on the quality of sentiment lexicon and thus hard to cover the network language arose spontaneously",1,
281,,acl_cambridge,,The main conceptual shortcoming of using correlation-based metrics is that they aggregate scores of different pairs — even though these scores can vary greatly in the embedding space,1,
282,,acl_cambridge,,To solve the problem of high dimensionality,1,
283,,acl_cambridge,,One drawback to the uniformsized cell representation is that it introduces class imbalance : urban areas tend to contain far more tweets than rural areas,1,
284,,acl_cambridge,,Another limitation is that WIT cannot deal with multiple speech recognition candidates such as those in an N-best list,1,
285,,acl_cambridge,,The corresponding drawback to such an approach is that its predictions are not validated on actual documents,1,
286,,acl_cambridge,,"A possible drawback is that for some inputs , the right output might not be available in the set considered by the training data , even if it might easily be constructed from known parts using a generative approach",1,
287,,acl_cambridge,,"The rise in F1-scores for partial matches is noteworthy , as it highlights the problem of different interpretations of clause spans",1,
288,,acl_cambridge,,The evaluation was done on an English-French parallel corpus but is confronted with the important limitation of having only one valid translation ( the aligned translation in the parallel corpus ) as a gold standard translation,1,
289,,acl_cambridge,,"The disadvantage is that , as all the results are not manually validated , some resulting classifications can appear incorrect",1,
290,,acl_cambridge,,"Researchers have typically used this data to incorporate a great deal of structural syntactic information in their models ( e.g. Ramshaw , 2001 ) , but the obvious weakness of these approaches is the resulting reliance on manually annotated examples , which are expensive and time-consuming to create",1,
291,,acl_cambridge,,Another weakness of the current version of the system is the type-checking which is not fully implemented,1,
292,,acl_cambridge,,But in parsing we have a problem of the explosion of possible constituents,1,
293,,acl_cambridge,,Another disadvantage of carrying out reordering in reranking is the representativeness of the N-best list is often a question mark,1,
294,,acl_cambridge,,"Another problem is that frequency is not always useful for detecting mistakes , because the norm can be very separated from real use",1,
295,,acl_cambridge,,The bottleneck in Artificial Intelligence is the unbalanced knowledge sources shared by human beings and a computer system,1,
296,,acl_cambridge,,One essential drawback of pointing gestures is their inevitable dependency on the here-and-now,1,
297,,acl_cambridge,,Their disadvantage is that a tagged corpus is essential for training,1,
298,,acl_cambridge,,"The drawback of these approaches , as discussed in the introduction , is that they do not directly model events , which have structured information",1,
299,,acl_cambridge,,"It is trivial to implement , but the disadvantage is , of course , that we would have to store one rule for each utterance that we would like our system to produce",1,
300,,acl_cambridge,,"We consider the problem of NER in Arabic Wikipedia , a semisupervised domain adaptation setting for which we have no labeled training data in the target domain",1,
301,,acl_cambridge,,"A drawback is that this structure may be cubic in the length of the parsed sentence , and more generally polynomial for some proposed algorithms",1,
302,,acl_cambridge,,One drawback of WTMF for our purposes is that it simply models the text-to-word information without leveraging the correlation between short texts,1,
303,,acl_cambridge,,Di Eugenio raised the issue of the effect of skewed distributions on the value of K,1,
304,,acl_cambridge,,Another drawback to using an existing external gold standard such as COMLEX to evaluate an automatically induced subcategorization lexicon is that the resources are not necessarily constructed from the same source data,1,
305,,acl_cambridge,,The main limitation is that the quality of the output is very susceptible to the quality and amount of resources available,1,
306,,acl_cambridge,,Another limitation of the proposed ( univariate ) analysis lies in the fact that it exclusively focuses on error types taken in isolation,1,
307,,acl_cambridge,,"The formalism presented by Kornai ( 1996 ) allows a significant reduction in the network size , but its main disadvantage lies in the fact that it significantly deviates from the standard methodology of developing finite-state devices , and integration of vectorized automata with standard ones remains a challenge",1,
308,,acl_cambridge,,"Despite these advantages and promising results , NMT has a limitation in handling a larger target vocabulary , as the complexity of training and decoding increases proportionally to the number of target words",1,
309,,acl_cambridge,,"The search for the best variant is repeated several times , what allows correcting rather complex errors , but does not completely solve the problem of falling into local minima",1,
310,,acl_cambridge,,"During this task , the problem of unknown word",1,
311,,acl_cambridge,,The other issue is that ONSET can also play a role for triggering resyllabification,1,
312,,acl_cambridge,,A major drawback of inducing normalization lexicons using most approaches described in Section 2 is that they are restricted to learning one-to-one word mappings,1,
313,,acl_cambridge,,The benefit of this approach is that the distribution of landing sites of this saccade can be modeled using standard statistical tools ; the drawback is that information about eye movement events following this first regressive saccade is lost,1,
314,,acl_cambridge,,The main drawback is that training time is increased because of the extra nested loop needed to calculate feature covariances,1,
315,,acl_cambridge,,"However , the drawback is that an adaption to a different dialogue system or to new modalities is quite expensive",1,
316,,acl_cambridge,,One widely acknowledged limitation is that the use of reference answers makes it impossible to compare systems that use different dialog strategies for carrying out the same task,1,
317,,acl_cambridge,,"A key limitation is the logical nature of automated planning systems , which do not handle probabilistic grammars , or force ad-hoc approaches for doing so ( Bauer and Koller , 2010 )",1,
318,,acl_cambridge,,"The system tackles the effect of negations and quantifiers in sentiment analysis , and addresses the problem of word ambiguity",1,
319,,acl_cambridge,,"However , this approach has several practical limitations : ( 1 ) it does not consider the problem of argument identification of SRL systems , treating arguments as already given ; ( 2 ) it generates rules for the argument classification step preferably from manually annotated data ; ( 3 ) it has been demonstrated for a single language ( French ) , and was not applied to any other language",1,
320,,acl_cambridge,,One drawback of evaluating on a downstream task is that evaluation is typically slower compared to using an intrinsic metric,1,
321,,acl_cambridge,,"In short , one important shortcoming of existing large scale semantic grammars is that they do not assign semantically equivalent sentences the same semantic representation",1,
322,,acl_cambridge,,This would have the disadvantage of complicating the feature space,1,
323,,acl_cambridge,,"A second limitation is that various metrics may be highly correlated with one another , and provide redundant information on performance",1,
324,,acl_cambridge,,To solve the sparsity issue,1,
325,,acl_cambridge,,The problem is that the non-contiguous elements in a verbchain are assigned into a single node while the subject in between belongs to its own node,1,
326,,acl_cambridge,,"The main drawback with these approaches lies in the WordNet structure itself , where frequently two semantically similar senses are distant in the WordNet hierarchy",1,
327,,acl_cambridge,,The problem is that when we do this we actually increase the lexical sparsity,1,
328,,acl_cambridge,,"Thus , we can overcome effectively the problem of unobserved co-occurrences of words in the training corpus",1,
329,,acl_cambridge,,A more general shortcoming is that the word form of an unknown word often contains useful information that is not available in the present setup,1,
330,,acl_cambridge,,Fundamentally the problem is that very conservative approaches to exact and partial string matches overgenerate badly,1,
331,,acl_cambridge,,The shortcoming of this text representation is the increase of its size with the increase of the text or the n-gram length,1,
332,,acl_cambridge,,A second limitation of the approach presented in this paper is that the metric used to measure the similarity between strings ( n-gram overlap ) is only a crude approximation of an ideal semantic similarity metric,1,
333,,acl_cambridge,,A limitation of the aforementioned patterns is that they capture associations when the CH and SV occur in close textual distance,1,
334,,acl_cambridge,,A frequent response to the problem of an explosion of syntactic parses in natural language systems,1,
335,,acl_cambridge,,The other difficulty is caused by limited data,1,
336,,acl_cambridge,,"It is , however , not intended to replace corpus studies because it has the drawback of not being able to take into account the influence of a wider linguistic environment",1,
337,,acl_cambridge,,"However , in real situations , the problem of tying",1,
338,,acl_cambridge,,"A disadvantage is that each request involves the overhead of starting a new Prolog process , and a consequently inflated response time , as well as complex arrangements to maintain dialogue state information",1,
339,,acl_cambridge,,These dozens of generalized semantic tags help to address the issue of feature sparseness,1,
340,,acl_cambridge,,"So far , we have not addressed the problem of unknown words",1,
341,,acl_cambridge,,The primary drawback is that KB annotations are currently present only if there is a YAGO means relation between the mention string and the correct entity,1,
342,,acl_cambridge,,"However , the main limitation of existing studies is that the individuals’ propensity of alignment is only characterized using a proportion of lexical elements",1,
343,,acl_cambridge,,"Another limitation is that although the resulting performance of our models seems encouraging , it is not obvious that we have learned particularly useful clues about what differentiates the English written by authors with different native languages",1,
344,,acl_cambridge,,Its main weakness is that it does not take into account the semantic similarities between the words that are combined in the CDSM models,1,
345,,acl_cambridge,,The other problem is existence of nonadaptive sentences that may be inappropriate in some of the scenes,1,
346,,acl_cambridge,,"The disadvantage of this slow , gentle approach is that even by the end of the book , neither Prolog nor parsing has been covered in depth",1,
347,,acl_cambridge,,The drawback is that there is a margin of error in the parallel segment identification and alignment,1,
348,,acl_cambridge,,A major drawback is the low coverage of the lexicon,1,
349,,acl_cambridge,,"However , the major shortcoming is that the feature set , even with feature selection , may fit the labeled source data well but not the target data because the target data has no labels to be used in feature selection",1,
350,,acl_cambridge,,"A drawback of computing each ai locally is that the system does not take into account constraints from mentions outside of the ( mention , antecedent ) pairs",1,
351,,acl_cambridge,,One drawback is that the parsing process might slow down the system significantly,1,
352,,acl_cambridge,,The main limitation of purity is that it gives poor results when the number of clusters is different from the real number of valid classes,1,
353,,acl_cambridge,,"One limitation is that these proposed tools rely on resources of limited coverage , such as dictionaries , thesauri , or manually constructed databases to generate the candidates",1,
354,,acl_cambridge,,Another limitation is that only five predefined realisations of REs were used to elicit object descriptions from the participants,1,
355,,acl_cambridge,,An additional drawback is that all existing systems can be used for analysis but not for generation,1,
356,,acl_cambridge,,"The challenge with such analysis is that OSN data come with no annotations , and it would be impossible to manually annotate the data for a quantitative analysis of self-disclosure",1,
357,,acl_cambridge,,"This has the potential drawback of increasing the number of features , which can make MERT less stable ( Foster and Kuhn , 2009 )",1,
358,,acl_cambridge,,The shortcoming is it may bring extra noises into our system,1,
359,,acl_cambridge,,A major problem with this data is that the sentences are artificially constructed for the LSAT and GRE tests,1,
360,,acl_cambridge,,"One drawback of using iterative bootstrapping is the sensitivity of this method to the set of initial seeds ( Pantel et al. , 2009 )",1,
361,,acl_cambridge,,"In spite of their success , a key limitation of phrase-based systems is that they make little or no direct use of syntactic information",1,
362,,acl_cambridge,,"The most obvious method would be to simply output the highest scoring word class , but this has the disadvantage of discarding much of the information present in the soft labeling",1,
363,,acl_cambridge,,We counter the problem of a large parameter space,1,
364,,acl_cambridge,,"The second issue is that there has been little consistency in the field in the use of cross-validation , the number of L1s , and which L1s are used",1,
365,,acl_cambridge,,Another problem is the fact that different spellings of a word are linked to the same index,1,
366,,acl_cambridge,,A drawback is that the corpus is not publicly available yet,1,
367,,acl_cambridge,,"Another drawback of the model proposed here is that there is no obvious way of showing how new schemas might be developed , or how existing ones might be modified",1,
368,,acl_cambridge,,A more serious limitation is that the present framework can handle only one anchor point ( the question term ) in the candidate answer sentence,1,
369,,acl_cambridge,,Its major drawback is the low number of paraphrases,1,
370,,acl_cambridge,,A drawback is that a grammar may need a large number of categories and rules,1,
371,,acl_cambridge,,The other problem is that the parse trees of original and compressed sentences sometimes do not correspond,1,
372,,acl_cambridge,,"We focus briefly on the issue of feedback in SLT systems , pointing out the difficulties of relying on text-based paraphrases",1,
373,,acl_cambridge,,But drawback noticed in this approach is that such techniques cannot be extended with semantically analyzed structures for target identification,1,
374,,acl_cambridge,,A challenge to our transducer model on the NUCLE dataset is the length of sentences,1,
375,,acl_cambridge,,One problem is that Fong 's approach does not extend to the VIA-reading ( in Jackendoff 's terminology ) of sentences like Example ( 3 ),1,
376,,acl_cambridge,,A potential shortcoming of the one-step model is that the probability distribution over dialogue acts is prone to distortion depending on the portion of NoMove in the training data,1,
377,,acl_cambridge,,In order to help overcome possible problems of combinatorial explosion,1,
378,,acl_cambridge,,The major disadvantage is that the greedy parsing strategy may lead to error propagation,1,
379,,acl_cambridge,,"The second drawback is that the criterion for selecting patterns , precision , is not the only issue for a pattern to be effective",1,
380,,acl_cambridge,,"From a cognitive perspective , the most obvious weakness of our algorithm is its strict incrementality",1,
381,,acl_cambridge,,"Although this method does not require the availability of English pronunciation , it has a serious limitation because it does not provide a mechanism for inserting the omitted short vowels in Arabic names",1,
382,,acl_cambridge,,"One shortcoming of this approach , for which the second evaluation seeks to compensate , is that a very small , and likely biased , subset of the policy sections is considered",1,
383,,acl_cambridge,,This function has the disadvantage that longer definitions are prefered over short ones,1,
384,,acl_cambridge,,"Continuing to focus on the materialised KB2 , we note another limitation of existing works : if only existential quantifiers are used then some objects are unidentifiable ( i.e. , it is not possible to distinguish them uniquely )",1,
385,,acl_cambridge,,A major challenge for neural network LMs is how to handle the words at the output layer since the softmax normalization would be very costly for large vocabularies,1,
386,,acl_cambridge,,One shortcoming of querying a search engine to obtain training pairs is it tends to be costly in terms of time and bandwidth,1,
387,,acl_cambridge,,"However , an obvious drawback is that the actual lexical information gets lost in favor of marking IGs , preventing the potential usage of that information in deciding on inter-word dependencies",1,
388,,acl_cambridge,,The drawback is that the complexity in syntactic processing is coupled with semantic parsing and makes the latter even harder,1,
389,,acl_cambridge,,A difficulty to achieving this is the exponential relationship between the number of possible paraphrases of a summary of a set of facts and the number of facts in that set,1,
390,,acl_cambridge,,Obviously a major drawback of the approach is its cost : associating concept tags with a dialogue transcription is already a tedious task and its complexity is largely increased by the requirement for a precise delimitation of the support ( lexical segment ) corresponding to each tag,1,
391,,acl_cambridge,,"From our error analysis , the problem of semantically isolated senses ( identified as neighbors )",1,
392,,acl_cambridge,,One limitation of all these methods is that they are designed to find only full sentences,1,
393,,acl_cambridge,,The second drawback is that 38 % of the slots that were identified are considered by the human judges to be too general,1,
394,,acl_cambridge,,Another limitation of the current implementation is the limited scope of the similarity function,1,
395,,acl_cambridge,,"The drawback is that the identification of mentions is subject to errors , and thus suffers a lower precision compared to hashtag matching",1,
396,,acl_cambridge,,Yet another drawback of the lattice representation is that the independence between many choices can not be fully exploited,1,
397,,acl_cambridge,,A first limitation is the n-gram simulations only use a window of n moves in the dialogue history,1,
398,,acl_cambridge,,"Based on the comments , the only drawback of the video annotation task is the time required to load and watch the videos",1,
399,,acl_cambridge,,"The main problem is that even though several Slavic languages have the same property as Czech , the ambiguity is not preserved",1,
400,,acl_cambridge,,"Decision trees [ 2 ] can handle complex condition , but they have a limitation in consuming very large parameter spaces",1,
401,,acl_cambridge,,The problem was that such probabilities could not be estimated directly from the data due to data sparseness,1,
402,,acl_cambridge,,The third limitation of the Levenshtein metric is that a deviation between two scanpaths in one fixation leads to an increase of the dissimilarity of 1 irrespective of whether the deviation is spatially large or small,1,
403,,acl_cambridge,,The only weakness of this strategy is its apparent inadequacy in dealing with the sparse data problem,1,
