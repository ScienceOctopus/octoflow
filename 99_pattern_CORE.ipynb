       "7189  In environmental microbiology, the most commonly used methods of bacterial DNA transfer are conjugation and electroporation. However, conjugation requires physical contact and cell–pilus–cell interactions; electroporation requires low-ionic strength medium and high voltage. These limitations have hampered broad applications of bacterial DNA delivery.

Social representations in the public sphere constitute the symbolic dimension within which responses to HIV and AIDS are conceptualised and transformed into action. Through an analysis of newspaper articles, we explore the dominant representations of HIV/AIDS management circulating in the South African public sphere and examine how community engagement is depicted. We highlight the way media represe...   \n",

However, fine-scale information about these strategies has hitherto been difficult to obtain for diving predators that often remain at the sea surface for only limited periods of time. Using ARGOS telemetry and novel, low-powered, archival GPS, we followed the fine-scale at-sea behaviour of king penguins breeding on South Georgia. Results revealed that foraging pathways were generally linear, except at the finest scale, where movements probably reflected either...   \n",

In ECT, capacitances of pairs of electrodes placed around the periphery are measured and in EMT, mutual induction of pairs of coils is measured.

More than 600 leaves were collected from birch trees and their remanent magnetization (IRM300 mT) determined and normalized for the leaf area. The results show that this normalised 2-D magnetization is dominantly controlled by the tree's distance to the road. The magnetic analyses enabled detailed mapping of the spatial and temporal variations of vehicle-derived particulates. Higher 2D-magnetizations, indicating ...   \n",

The answer has to be –'not at all well'. But why is this and does it matter? Part one of this paper considers what research on health care organisations was being conducted in the early years of the Journal and why that work was not viewed with favour by sociologists. Part two examines the growing gulf between those who saw themselves principally as responding to the call for a sociology of health and illness informed by broader socio...   \n",

       "648   The notion of software as a service promises agile, flexible and low maintenance system development through a dynamic runtime architecture that allows third-party functionality and capability to be added on demand. There is growing research interest in how service-orientation can be adopted a means for enhancing agility and flexibility in product line engineering. However, integrating service-orientation in product line engineering poses a number of challenges. These include difficulty in identifying services, ensuring services reflect user needs, and determining configurations of services...   \n",

In this limit the disturbance decays exponentially in time at a rate that is linked to a pole of the associated linear inviscid problem (known as a Landau pole). As a model of a typical vortex distribution that can give rise to cat's eyes, here distributions are examined that have a basic Gaussian shape but whose profiles have been artificially flattened about some radius r_c. A numerical study of the Landau poles for this family of v...   \n",

       "'this article discuss some of the merit and demerit of the single - payer model of health care financing , with particular reference to the English National Health Service ( NHS ) . specifically , it be argue that the main merit be that the model can directly provide universal health care coverage , thus eradicate or at least alleviate market failure and equity concern , and that it can achieve this with relatively low total health care expenditure in general and — as compare to the commercial multiple insurance model — low administrative cost in particular . a perceive demerit of the single - payer model be that it can lead to excessive health care rationing , particularly in term of waiting time , although it be argue here that long wait be probably cause by insufficient funding rather than by the single - payer model per se . moreover , rationing of one form or another occur in all health care system , and single - payer model may be the good option if the aim be to incorporate structured ration such that an entire population be subject to the same rule and be thus treat equitably . a far perceive disadvantage of the single - payer model be that it offer limited choice , which be necessarily true with respect to choice of insurer , but choice of provider can be , and increasingly be , a feature of centrally tax - finance health care system . no model of health care funding be perfect ; trade - off be inevitable . whether the merit of the single - payer model be judge to outweigh the demerit will typically vary both across country at any point in time and within a country over time'"
