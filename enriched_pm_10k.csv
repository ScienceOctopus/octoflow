No effective diagnostic or treatment tools are readily available. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulins in children with new onset dilated cardiomyopathy. Methods and results In this retrospective cohort study, 94 children with new onset dilated cardiomyopathy were followed during a median period of 33 months. All patients with secondary dilated cardiomyopathy - for example, genetic, auto-immune or structural defects - had been excluded. Viral tests were performed in all patients and 18 (19%) children met the criteria for the diagnosis ""probable or definite viral myocarditis"". Intravenous immunoglobulins were administered to 21 (22%) patients. Overall transplant-free survival was 75% in 5 years and did not differ between treatment groups. The treatment was associated with a higher recovery rate within 5 years, compared with non-treated children (70 versus 43%, log rank=0.045). After correction for possible confounders the hazard ratio for recovery with intravenous immunoglobulins was not significant (hazard ratio: 2.1; 95% CI: 1.0-4.6; p=0.056). Administration of intravenous immunoglobulins resulted in a greater improvement in the shortening fraction of the left ventricle.",None,None,None,"In our population of children with new onset dilated cardiomyopathy, of either viral or idiopathic origin, intravenous immunoglobulins were administered to a minority of the patients and did not influence transplant-free survival, but were associated with better improvement of systolic left ventricular function and with better recovery. Our results support the concept that children with new onset dilated cardiomyopathy might benefit from intravenous immunoglobulins."

Appropriate preoperative intravenous antibiotics were administered for all patients. Bacitracin topical antibiotic ointment was routinely applied to the sternal surgical incision after skin closure for all patients during this period. The incidence of sternal wound infection was assessed.","During this 9-year experience, no episodes of deep sternal wound infections were observed, compared with a predicted rate of 0.29% (interquartile range: 0.19% to 0.46%) based on The Society of Thoracic Surgeons National Database risk calculator. Four episodes of superficial sternal wound infections were noted; gram-positive organisms were cultured in the majority of these cases. Bacitracin ointment was well tolerated by patients, with no serious adverse effects reported.","This study suggests that the routine application of topical bacitracin over the surgical skin incision is safe after cardiac surgery. Deep sternal wound infections were notably absent during this period. As a readily available and inexpensive therapy, this simple intervention may be a useful adjunct strategy in preventing sternal wound infections."

Our institution has adopted the use of volumetric arc therapy (VMAT) due to superior sparing of the adjacent organs at risk (OARs) compared to intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Here we report our clinical experience by analyzing target coverage and sparing of OARs for 90 clinical treatment plans.,None,"VMAT and IMRT patient cohorts comprising 45 patients each were included in this study. For all patients, the planning target volume (PTV) received 50 Gy in 30 fractions, and the simultaneous integrated boost PTV received 60 Gy. The characteristics of the two patient cohorts were examined for similarity. The doses to target volumes and OARs, including brain, brainstem, hippocampi, optic nerves, eyes, and cochleae were then compared using statistical analysis. Target coverage and normal tissue sparing for six patients with both clinical IMRT and VMAT plans were analyzed.","PTV coverage of at least 95% was achieved for all plans, and the median mean dose to the boost PTV differed by only 0.1 Gy between the IMRT and VMAT plans. Superior sparing of the brainstem was found with VMAT, with a median difference in mean dose being 9.4 Gy. The ipsilateral cochlear mean dose was lower by 19.7 Gy, and the contralateral cochlea was lower by 9.5 Gy. The total treatment time was reduced by 5 min. The difference in the ipsilateral hippocampal D<sub>100%</sub> was 12 Gy, though this is not statistically significant (P = 0.03).","VMAT for GBM patients can provide similar target coverage, superior sparing of the brainstem and cochleae, and be delivered in a shorter period of time compared with IMRT. The shorter treatment time may improve clinical efficiency and the quality of the treatment experience. Based on institutional clinical experience, use of VMAT for the treatment of GBMs appears to offer no inferiority in comparison to IMRT and may offer distinct advantages, especially for patients who may require re-irradiation."

We are unaware if PRL is a positive or negative immunomodulator, but its effects on the regulation of T cells could inhibit the antitumor activity elicited by nivolumab (NIVO). We aimed to assess whether the occurrence of hyperprolactinemia in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC) patients treated with NIVO is associated with poor clinical outcomes.",We evaluated 26 mNSCLC patients treated with NIVO. Blood samples were collected in every patient to evaluate PRL basal levels before starting the therapy with NIVO and before each following administration of NIVO. All patients underwent a conventional CT to investigate the effect of therapy according to Immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (IrRECIST).,"Twenty patients (77%) developed hyperprolactinemia during the treatment, whereas 6 patients (23%) had stable levels of PRL during the therapy (p = 0.001). A total of 95% of the 20 patients with hyperprolactinemia had progressive disease (PD), according to CT results, whereas only 2 patients (33%) out of 6 with stable PRL levels had PD (p = 0.004).","Hyperprolactinemia in mNSCLC patients treated with NIVO could potentially represent a negative early predictive factor for poor clinical outcomes, thus anticipating PD shown by CT scan."

The BioMonitor 2-AF is a novel insertable ILR with enhanced atrial fibrillation (AF) detection algorithm and remote monitoring capability.,"The objective of this first-in-human study with the BioMonitor 2-AF was to analyze course of P-wave sensing performance and R-wave amplitude, prevalence of false and correctly sensed and classified episodes, and effectiveness of remote monitoring.","All 19 patients who underwent ILR insertion were included in the BIOTRONIK Home Monitoring® system (BIOTRONIK GmbH, Berlin, Germany). Daily changes in P-wave and R-wave sensing were analyzed over 6 weeks. A breathing test (in- and expiration) was performed in two different body positions at baseline and during a 6-week in-house follow-up to investigate alterations of P-wave and R-wave sensing.","R-wave amplitude and the high P-wave visibility (94.4%) remained unchanged during the follow-up period. In most patients both an increase and decrease of R-wave amplitude, and in some cases a complete R-wave vector change (31.6%), was documented during the ""breathing test."" Change of body position did not alter R-wave sensing amplitude mostly. ""Breathing test"" and change of body position had no effect on P-wave sensing performance. In 15.8% of the patients, misclassification of episodes as AF or high ventricular rates due to P-wave oversensing occurred. No ILR-related complication occurred. Automatic transmission via BIOTRONIK Home Monitoring® was successful 100% of the time.",This study demonstrates that the BioMonitor 2-AF is a safe and effective tool for continuous cardiac monitoring.

Although there are clear guidelines regarding management and transplant listing criteria for patients with PoPH, the listing criteria for PVH are not well defined.",The aim of this study was to describe and compare the perioperative and postoperative morbidity and mortality associated with PoPH and PVH in patients undergoing liver transplantation.,"We conducted a retrospective observational study of all patients referred for liver transplantation to our center between 2005 and 2015 who underwent a right heart catheterization (RHC) for screening for pulmonary hypertension as suggested by initial echocardiography. Based on the RHC data, the patients were grouped into no pulmonary hypertension (No PH), PoPH, and PVH categories. In patients who underwent liver transplantation, we recorded vital status intraoperatively and at 30 days and 1-year post-transplant, and we recorded the incidence of postoperative cardiopulmonary and renal complications.","Of the 134 patients who underwent RHC as part of the initial transplant evaluation, 50 patients were successfully transplanted. There was 1 intraoperative death in the PoPH group. No significant difference in mortality was noted between the No PH, PoPH, and PVH groups intraoperatively and 30 days after liver transplantation. At 1 year, the survival rates were 100%, 69.2%, and 94.1% in the No PH, PoPH, and PVH groups, respectively. With respect to cardiopulmonary and renal complications, no statistically significant difference was noted among the groups, though there was a trend toward increased post-transplant reversible pulmonary complications in the PVH group.","Our findings suggest that the post-transplant outcomes of patients with PoPH and PVH are similar. In light of the growing recognition of diastolic dysfunction and cirrhotic cardiomyopathy in decompensated cirrhotic patients at the time of transplant, the issue of pulmonary hypertension related to PVH will gain increasing importance as we assess these patients for transplantation. Therefore, future studies are needed to define evidence based guidelines to determine candidacy for liver transplantation in the context of PVH."

Three episodes of urinary tract infections (UTIs) occurred in the 1-week stent group, and 18 such episodes were recorded in the 4-week stent group (5.8% vs 29.4%; P = .002). After adjusting for age, sex, ischemia time, renal artery number, body mass index, multiple arteries, and associated medical illness, regression analysis indicated that only stent duration was associated with UTI (OR, 8.791; 95% CI, 1.984-38.943; P = .004).",The results of our study demonstrate that ureteral stent removal at 1 week reduces the risk of UTIs compared with routine removal at 4 weeks. Similar effects of ureteral stent removal on complication rates are observed for these two removal times.

Sixteen and 14 eyes of POAG patients were randomized to receive 360° SLT or 0.004% travoprost, respectively. Fourteen and 16 eyes of NTG patients were randomized to receive either SLT or travoprost, respectively. The 24-hour IOP data were collected before treatment and 6 to 8 weeks after treatment. IOP was measured at 2 hours intervals in the sitting position during daytime (9 AM to 7 PM) and in the supine position during nighttime (9 PM to 7 AM). Main outcome measure was the percentage of eyes that achieved posttreatment 24-hour IOP fluctuations <3 mm Hg.

Overall, eyes in the SLT and the travoprost groups achieved a significant reduction in IOP compared with the baseline IOP values (-3.7 mm Hg [P = 0.002] vs -4.1 mm Hg [P < 0.001], respectively). There was no significant difference in IOP reduction in both groups according to type of glaucoma. During the diurnal period, 100% of POAG eyes in the travoprost group achieved posttreatment IOP fluctuations <3 mm Hg, and 87% of eyes in the SLT group achieved the same level of fluctuations (P < 0.001). Ninety-six percent of NTG eyes in the travoprost group, and 82% of eyes in the SLT group had IOP fluctuations <3 mm Hg (P = 0.01). Success in fluctuation reduction was 75% and 92% for the SLT and travoprost groups, respectively (P = 0.005). The effect of travoprost on IOP reduction in POAG and NTG patients was significant both during the daytime and the nighttime, while the SLT's effect was significant only during the nighttime.","Both travoprost and SLT can significantly reduce the IOP in patients with POAG and NTG. Based on habitual positions, travoprost better controls IOP fluctuations than SLT, especially during the daytime."

Procalcitonin (PCT) is widely used for diagnosis of a bacterial infection. The objective of this study was to assess PCT dynamics after LVAD surgery and their relationship to the infectious complications.,None,"A total of 25 consecutive patients indicated for LVAD implantation as a bridge to heart transplant were included. Procalcitonin levels were prospectively assessed before surgery and during the postoperative period (day 1, 2, 14 and 30). Values were compared according to the presence of IC.","Procalcitonin levels were low before surgery, raised significantly within 1st and 2nd day after operation and decreased in the 14th and 30th days back to the baseline. There was no significant difference in PCT values between patients with or without IC as well as with or without right ventricle assist device (RVAD). Acute renal failure (ARF) increased PCT significantly only 14 days after LVAD implantation. In patients with ARF and/or RVAD we observed significantly higher PCT values in the 2nd, 14<sup>th</sup> and 30<sup>th</sup> day after operation. In subjects with IC and/or ARF and/or RVAD we also observed significantly elevated PCT concentrations 2 and 14 days after surgery.",Our data show that the ability of PCT to detect IC in patients after LVAD implantation is limited and its concentrations more likely correlate with postoperative complications in general.

Second, we aimed to test whether this association is in part due to difficulties in current parent-child relationships.","This was an observational study, whereby 150 parents were interviewed about their childhood SES and their children (physician-diagnosed asthma, ages 9-17 years) were interviewed about current family stress. Asthma control was assessed by parent report and child report (primary outcome), and blood was collected from children to measure cytokine production relevant to asthma (secondary outcomes).","To the degree that parents had lower childhood SES, their offspring showed worse asthma outcomes across multiple indicators.

Blood tests included hemoglobin, hematocrit, albumin, solutes (Na/K/Cl/BUN/Cr), and b-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). The relative change in the vascular expansion from stable to worsening HF was estimated based on changes in the plasma volume (%PV).","When divided into two groups based on the median %PV, the clinical features of the expansion group (11≤%PV [range 11% to 36%]; n=24) included a lower incidence of crackles (13% vs. 52%, p=0.005) and a tendency toward preserved renal function (83% vs. 57%, p=0.06) compared with the non-expansion group (%PV [range -19% to 11%]<11; n=23), whereas the increase in body weight and log BNP did not differ between groups. The expansion group had a greater increase in serum Na (3.58±4.43 vs. -0.11±3.31mEq/L, p=0.0016) and Cl (5.54±6.24 vs. -0.03±4.18mEq/L, p=0.0006), and a decrease in serum albumin (-0.37±0.3 vs. -0.16±0.3g/dL, p=0.04) and creatinine (-0.28±0.39 vs. -0.06±0.22mg/dL, p=0.027) from stability to worsening HF. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed an independent association between the increase in %PV and the increase in the serum Cl concentration from stability to worsening HF (odds ratio: 12.2, 95% confidence interval: 1.78-83.8, p=0.011).","Though this study is observational and does not allow for causal inference, it may nonetheless be speculated that a greater accumulation of Cl in the blood vessels acts to increase or maintain intravascular volume, which induces different clinical features of HF."

However, research supporting MT efficacy is based predominantly on weekly-meeting, facilitator-led, group-intervention formats. It is unknown whether participants might benefit from neurofeedback-assisted, technology-supported MT (N-tsMT), in which meditation is delivered individually, without the need for a facilitator, travel to a training site, or the presence of a supportive group environment. Mirroring the validation of group MT interventions, the first step in addressing this question requires identifying whether N-tsMT promotes measurable benefits. Here, we report on an initial investigation of a commercial N-tsMT system.",None,"In a randomized, active control trial, community-dwelling healthy adult participants carried out 6 weeks of daily practice, receiving either N-tsMT (n = 13), or a control condition of daily online math training (n = 13). Training effects were assessed on target measures of attention and well-being. Participants also completed daily post-training surveys assessing effects on mood, body awareness, calm, effort, and stress.","Analysis revealed training effects specific to N-tsMT, with attentional improvements in overall reaction time on a Stroop task, and well-being improvements via reduced somatic symptoms on the Brief Symptom Inventory. Attention and well-being improvements were correlated, and effects were greatest for the most neurotic participants. However, secondary, exploratory measures of attention and well-being did not show training-specific effects. N-tsMT was associated with greater body awareness and calm, and initially greater effort that later converged with effort in the control condition.","Preliminary findings indicate that N-tsMT promotes modest benefits for attention and subjective well-being in a healthy community sample relative to an active control condition. However, the findings would benefit from replication in a larger sample, and more intensive practice or more comprehensive MT instruction might be required to promote the broader benefits typically reported in group format, facilitated MT."

One important aim is to reduce plantar pressure under prominent areas like metatarsal heads. For the forefoot region, mainly two common strategies exist: metatarsal pad (MP) and forefoot cushioning (FC). The aim of this study was to evaluate which of these orthosis concepts is superior in reducing plantar pressure in the forefoot during running.",None,"Twenty-three (13 female, 10 male) asymptomatic runners participated in this cross-sectional experimental trial. Participants ran in a randomised order under the two experimental (MP, FC) conditions and a control (C) condition on a treadmill (2.78 ms<sup>-1</sup>) for 2 min, respectively. Plantar pressure was measured with the in-shoe plantar pressure measurement device pedar-x®-System and mean peak pressure averaged from ten steps in the forefoot (primary outcome) and total foot was analysed. Insole comfort was measured with the Insole Comfort Index (ICI, sum score 0-100) after each running trial. The primary outcome was tested using the Friedman test (α = 0.05). Secondary outcomes were analysed descriptively (mean ± SD, lower & upper 95%-CI, median and interquartile-range (IQR)).","Peak pressure [kPa] in the forefoot was significantly lower wearing FC (281 ± 80, 95%-CI: 246-315) compared to both C (313 ± 69, 95%-CI: 283-343; <i>p</i> = .003) and MP (315 ± 80, 95%-CI: 280-350; <i>p</i> = .001).

In addition to the economic implications, there is emerging evidence that blood transfusion may increase both morbidity and mortality. Acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) may limit the need for blood products.","The primary objective of this study was to determine if the method of blood collection (syringe or bag) during the ANH process impacted the platelet count and function. The secondary objectives included the need for perioperative blood transfusions during the procedure and in the intensive care unit. In addition, we assessed these outcomes' associations with ANH parameters including the method of collection, time of storage, and volume removed.","Data were collected prospectively from 50 patients undergoing cardiac surgery on cardiopulmonary bypass over a 6-month period.

Twenty-three patients received blood or blood products in the operating room or the intensive care unit, while 27 patients received no blood transfusion during their entire hospitalization. Higher ANH volume (ml·kg<sup>-1</sup> ) and longer storage time were associated with a greater need for intraoperative transfusions.",Acute normovolemic hemodilution protects the platelets from the untoward effects of cardiopulmonary bypass and offers an important autologous blood product that improves hemostasis at the conclusion of surgery.

Secondary aims were to examine whether there were any microbiome differences between proximal and distal appendices, and relate the microbiome with histopathological findings.",A prospective pilot study was conducted of children undergoing appendectomy for appendicitis. The diagnosis was based on histopathological analysis. Children with incidental appendectomy were used as controls.

The amount of Fusobacterium increased and Bacteroides decreased in phlegmonous and perforated appendicitis compared to controls, but statistical significance was not reached, and this pattern was not seen in gangrenous appendicitis. No relation could be seen between different bacteria and the grade of inflammation, and there was a wide variation of abundances at phylum, genus, and species level within every specific group of patients. Further, no significant differences could be detected when comparing the microbiome in proximal and distal mucosa, which may be because the study was underpowered. A trend with more abundance of Fusobacteria in the distal mucosa was seen in appendicitis patients with obstruction (25 and 13 %, respectively, p = 0.06).","The pattern of microbiome differed not only between groups, but also within groups. However, no statistically significant differences could be found in the microbiome between groups or clinical conditions. No correlation between a specific bacteria and grade of inflammation was found. In the vast majority of cases of appendicitis, changes in microbiome do not seem to be the primary event. Since there seem to be differences in microbiome patterns depending on the sample site, the exact localization of biopsy sampling must be described in future studies."

Cardiac conduction disturbances require implantable cardiac pacemaker. Implantable defibrillators may also be necessary to prevent cardiac sudden death. The safety and risk of cardiac electronic devices' implantation are not known in patients with muscular dystrophy. We aimed to assess the risks related to cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIED) in muscular dystrophy patients ventilated by tracheostomy.",We reviewed all medical charts of neuromuscular patients and identified all CIED implantations of pacemakers (PM) or defibrillators (ICD) in patients ventilated using tracheostomy.,"Twelve device implantations were included, performed in 9 patients (5 DMD, 1 Becker muscular dystrophy and 3 DM1). Mean age was 39.9years±13.0. All patients were wheel-chair bound and tracheotomized. Six pacemakers (PM) and 6 cardiac resynchronization (CRT) devices, including 2 defibrillators (CRT-D) were implanted. Following device implantation, two patients had a pneumothorax and one died from severe heart failure after an unsuccessful CRT implant attempt. Follow-up lasted up to 8years (mean 2.6±2.9years), during which one patient presented a PM pocket infection, requiring PM explantation and epicardial reimplantation.",We found a high prevalence of early complications (16.6% pneumothorax) after CIED implantation and an acceptable long-term infectious risk (8.3%). These results highlight the feasibility of CIED implantation in tracheotomized patients with muscular dystrophies and the need for a particular caution in the management of these patients during invasive procedures.

In the absence of a sufficiently sensitive and specific laboratory test, identification of the culprit drug remains a diagnostic challenge. Patch tests have recently been advocated as a means of detecting drug sensitivity.",To further elucidate the usefulness of patch tests in revealing the causative drugs of cutaneous ADRs (CADRs).,"We conducted a non-blinded, prospective, controlled clinical trial. Twenty-five patients with a history of CADRs were patch tested, and 25 healthy subjects who had never experienced CADRs served as controls.","A morbilliform eruption was the most frequent skin reaction. Patch tests were positive in eight of the 25 patients with CADR (32%). Specifically, five of the 13 patients with morbilliform drug eruption (38.4%) tested positive, as did one of the four patients with erythema multiforme/Stevens-Johnson syndrome (25%), and one of the two patients with the drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome. Antibiotics and anticonvulsants resulted in positive patch tests most often. Patch test sensitivity was 32%, specificity was 92%, and negative and positive predictive values were 57.5% and 80%, respectively. Significant correlation was found between the patch test result and the clinical probability of a CADR according to the imputability score of the drug.","Patch testing for drugs causing ADRs shows high specificity rates even though the sensitivity is low. Such tests may therefore be useful in supporting the diagnosis of delayed-type CADRs, particularly when antibiotics or anticonvulsants are involved and the cutaneous reaction is a morbilliform rash."

Unnecessary imaging use should be reduced to prevent increased radiation exposure and lower costs. For this reason, scoring systems that evaluate the risk of ureteral stones have been developed. In this study, we aimed to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of the modified STONE score (MSS) and its ability to predict ureteral stones.","The research was conducted as a multi-center, prospective and observational study. Patients aged 18 and over who presented to EDs with complaints of flank pain and who received a CT were included. Patients were divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of stones, and the categories of the MSS were determined. The ability of the MSS to predict the ureteral stone and its diagnostic accuracy were calculated.","The median age (min/max) of the 367 study patients was 37 (18/91), and 244 (66.5%) were male. A ureteral stone was present in 228 (73.0%) patients.

Productive failure, which combines problem-solving tasks followed by instruction, enables students to learn from making mistakes. This teaching approach has demonstrated improved learning outcomes such as explanatory knowledge and transfer of knowledge compared to a direct instruction approach where students receive instruction prior to problem-solving tasks. However, no previous studies have examined the impact of productive failure on nursing students' learning in manikin-based simulation.","To measure the impact of productive failure on nursing students' declarative knowledge, explanatory knowledge, and transfer of knowledge compared to a direct instruction approach in a paediatric closed head injury simulation.",Second year undergraduate nursing students (n = 349) from one Australian university were invited to participate in the study. Consenting participants (n = 344) were randomised into two groups: productive failure and direct instruction. The intervention consisted of two paediatric closed head injury simulations separated by a simulation debrief. Knowledge tests were administered before and immediately after the simulation.,Data from 331 participants were analysed. The productive failure group outperformed the direct instruction group in the post-test (p < 0.001). Learning gains for participants in the productive failure group were significantly higher than the direct instruction group for both explanatory knowledge (p < 0.001) and the ability to apply learning to solve novel clinical problems (p < 0.001). The difference in the median scores for declarative knowledge was not significant (p = 0.096).,This study demonstrated that a productive failure simulation that leads learners to make mistakes before receiving instruction can facilitate deeper levels of explanatory knowledge and enable the transfer of learning to new clinical situations. These results suggest the need for further exploration of pedagogies that foster learning from errors in simulation-based learning.

All subjects underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. The ReHo technique was used to record spontaneous changes in brain activity. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were applied to differentiate between ReHo values for patients with DON and HCs.

Among these, the greatest difference was observed in the RMFG. The result of the ROC curves suggest that ReHo values in altered brain regions may help diagnose DON, and the RMFG and LAC ReHo values are more clinically relevant than SFG/LFSO. We also found that anxiety and depression scores of the DON group were extremely negatively correlated with the LAC ReHo values (<i>r</i> = -0.9336, <i>P</i> < 0.0001 and <i>r</i> = -0.8453, <i>P</i> < 0.0001, respectively).","Three different brain regions show ReHo changes in DON patients, and these changes could serve as diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarkers to further guide the prevention and treatment of DON patients."

Circadian plasma cortisol measurements were obtained at 11: 30 p.m. and at midnight, and at 7: 30 and 8: 00 a.m. The ratios between the morning and late-night concentrations were calculated.","Plasma cortisol early-morning and midnight (AM/PM) ratios negatively correlated with 24-h urinary free cortisol (UFC) collections among the full study population and in each of the individual etiologies. Plasma ACTH concentrations positively correlated with plasma cortisol AM/PM ratios among patients with ACTH-independent CS. Finally, patients with primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease showed no correlation between UFC collections and the plasma cortisol AM/PM ratio, in contrast with other etiologies for primary adrenal CS, which showed a strong negative correlation between them.",Our study shows the association between the plasma cortisol AM/PM ratio and the degree of hypercortisolemia in children with CS.

Pathology in the LFJ is a common source of lower back pain (LBP). It is responsible for chronic LBP in approximately 15% to 45% of patients. It has been reported that PRF stimulation can effectively reduce refractory joint pain.",None,"Sixty patients with LFJ pain were recruited and randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups: the IA PRF group and the ICI group. There were 30 patients in each group. At pretreatment, 2 weeks, 1, 3, and 6 months after treatment, we assessed the severity of LBP using a numeric rating scale (NRS).","Compared with the pretreatment NRS scores, patients in both groups showed a significant decrease in NRS scores at 2 weeks, and 1, 3, and 6 months after each treatment. Between groups, changes in the NRS scores were significantly different over time. At 2 weeks and 1 month after each procedure, the NRS score after ICI was significantly lower than that after the PRF stimulation. However, at 3 and 6 months after the procedures, the decrements of NRS scores were not significantly different between the 2 groups. Six months after treatment, about half of patients in both groups reported successful pain relief (pain relief of ≥50%).","In the current study, both IA PRF stimulation and ICI into the LFJ significantly relieved LFJ pain. Their effects persisted for at least 6 months after the procedure. Thus, IA PRF is a useful therapeutic option for the management of LFJ pain."

The actual measurement of the weight of a critically ill or injured child is often not possible. The Broselow Pediatric Emergency Tape (BT) is an important tool for predicting a child's weight based on his/her height. Although BT has previously been validated, given the increasing prevalence of obesity in today's society, it behooves clinicians relying on this resuscitation aid to revisit the issue.",The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of the color-coded BT in weight estimation and the influence of obesity on its accuracy.,"This is a retrospective study conducted in a pediatric clinic of urban hospital. This study reviewed the medical records of children up to 96 months of age, who presented during 2008-2010. We recorded the child's age (in months), actual (measured) weight (in kilograms), and height (in centimeters). Based on the height, weight estimation was obtained using the color-coded BT. The actual weight was compared with the predicted weight obtained by the height-based BT. Patients presenting with any medical condition that would substantially affect growth of the child were excluded. A univariate logistic regression model was utilized to predict any underestimation based on age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) percentile.","The medical records of 538 children were reviewed. There was a discrepancy in 226 children (42%). Broselow Pediatric Emergency Tape underestimated weight (measured weight was higher than predicted weight) in 158 children (29.4%) and overestimated (measured weight was lower than predicted weight) in 68 children (12.6%). Of the 158 underestimated children, 138 were off by 1 color zone, 16 by 2 color zones, and 4 by more than 2 color zones. When characterized by BMI, 46 children (13.6%) had normal BMI, 27 (45.8%) were overweight, and 84 (80.8%) were obese, whereas one child (2.8%) was underweight.","In our population, BT was inaccurate in predicting weight in 42% of children (underestimation in 158 children [29.4%] and overestimation weight in 68 children [12.6%]). However, the majority of discrepancies involved only 1 BT color zone. Emergency physicians should be aware of this discrepancy until more accurate methods become available."

Thus, the investigators are conducting this study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of QSG in a large, and varied population.",None,"This study is designed as a randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center, double-blind clinical trial with parallel groups. A total of 200 patients with CHF will be recruited and randomly allocated to either the QSG treatment group or the placebo group (in a 1:1 ratio). The patients will receive QSG or placebo granules twice a day for 12 weeks. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients in the QSG group, compared with the placebo group, demonstrating a more than 30% decrease in NT-proBNP level during 12 weeks of treatment. The secondary outcomes consist of composite cardiac events, New York Heart Association functional classification, 6-minute walking distance, left ventricular ejection fraction, patient quality of life, and the TCM syndrome integral scale.",None,"On a background of standard treatment, QSG may further reduce the levels of NT-proBNP. This trial will provide high-quality evidence on the efficacy and safety of QSG in treating CHF, thus providing reference for clinical application of QSG."

Effective ways to stably reduce LDL-C level are warranted in type 2 diabetic patients, a high-risk population for CVD, with various anti-diabetic therapeutic background.

We investigated the difference in cholesterol lowering effect between ezetimibe (10 mg) add-on statin (EAT) group and double-dose statin (DST) group. Changes of parameters related to atherosclerotic event risks were assessed.","The reduction of LDL-C was larger in the EAT group (28.3%) than in the DST group (9.2%) at 52 weeks as well as the primary endpoint of 12 weeks. EAT achieved significant lower levels of TC and apo B, respectively. Both treatments attained significant reduction in sd-LDL-C or hsCRP on this long-term basis. Notably, sd-LDL-C in EAT reduced as low as 36.1 ± 14.9 mg/dl to reach near the threshold (35.0 mg/dl) for atherosclerosis with significantly higher achievement rate (55.6%) than DST treatment. Simultaneously, hsCRP reduction by EAT attained as low value as 0.52 ± 0.43 mg/l.","In the present 52-week long-term period, ezetimibe add-on therapy showed a robust advantage in lowering LDL-C and in attaining target LDL-C values compared with the doubling of statin dose. Moreover, it's meaningful that sd-LDL, powerfully atherogenic lipoprotein, exhibited prominent decrease consistently prominently by ezetimibe add-on therapy. DM patients with hypercholesterolemia are at high risk for CAD, and adding ezetimibe onto usual-dose statin treatment in Japan has been suggested as the first-line therapy for those DM patients who failed to attain the target LDL-C value (UMIN000002593)."

Thirty women were assigned randomly to the VR intervention (immersive video content as a distraction method) group and 30 to the standard care group using a predetermined randomization code. The primary outcome measure was the visual analog scale (VAS) pain score, along with the women's ratings of their extent of anxiety experienced during the procedure. The VAS consisted of a 10 cm line ranging from 0 to 10 (anchored by 0 = no pain and 10=very severe pain). Anxiety was assessed on Spielberger's state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) questionnaire.","The patients' characteristics and obstetric data were similar in both groups.

Little is known about the impact of opioid administration in the emergency department (ED) for patients with low back pain.,This study compares 30-day return rates after administration of various pain management modalities for emergency department (ED) patients with low back pain.,"We conducted a retrospective multicenter observational study of patients in the ED who were diagnosed with low back pain and discharged home in 21 EDs between November 2018 and April 2020. Patients were categorized based on the pain management they received in the ED and compared with the reference group of patients receiving only nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, or a combination of the two. The proportions of ED return visits within 30 d for each medication category was calculated and associations between analgesia categories and proportions of return visits were assessed using logistic regression models to obtain odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).","Patients with low back pain who received any opioid, intravenous opioid, or intramuscular opioid had significantly increased proportions of a return visit within 30 d (32% [OR 1.78 {95% CI 1.21-2.64}]; 33% [OR 1.83 {95% CI 1.18-2.86}]; and 39% [OR 2.38 {95% CI 1.35-4.12}], respectively) when compared with patients who received nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (19%), acetaminophen (20%), or a combination of the two (8%).","Patients receiving opioids were more likely to return to the ED within 30 d than those receiving received nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or acetaminophen. This suggests that the use of opioids for low back pain in the ED may not be an effective strategy, and there may be an opportunity to appropriately treat more of these patients with nonopioid medications."

However, there are few studies on PDT combined with isotretinoin of moderate to severe acne.",To evaluate the efficacy and safety of PDT combined with isotretinoin in the treatment of moderate to severe acne.,"70 cases of moderate and severe acne patients were randomly divided into PDT group and combination group. In combination group, patients were treated with PDT, once/2weeks, for 3 times; and oral isotretinoin, 10 mg twice a day for 3 months. The PDT group was treated with PDT alone. The skin lesions were counted before treatment and in the 4th, 6th, 8th, and 12th weeks to evaluate the clinical efficacy. Adverse reactions during the treatment were recorded.

There was no significant difference in pain score between two groups during the photodynamic therapy(P＞0.05). Adverse reactions, such as erythema and pustule during photodynamic therapy in both groups were tolerable. The pigmentation subsided in about 3 months. The recurrence rate of combination group was significantly lower than that of PDT group(7% VS 24 %,P＜0.05).","PDT combined with isotretinoin has higher effective rate and lower recurrence rate than single PDT, and is a choice for the treatment of moderate to severe acne."

Alerts triggered by the remote monitoring system were included prospectively in a register. During a mean follow-up of 5.7±1.3 years, a total of 1594 patients with an ICD (441 with resynchronisation function) followed with remote monitoring were included in the register.","Among 15,874 alerts, only 10 were related to a reversion to back-up mode. Among those, seven reversions were caused by radiotherapy, two were fake events and one was caused by magnetic resonance imaging. Except for the two fake events, the eight other patients had an emergency admission for the resetting and reprogramming of their ICD. None of the reversion to back-up mode alerts was followed by a clinical alert (i.e. a shock alert) before the ICD problem was resolved.","Reversion to back-up mode is a very rare event, accounting for 0.06% of total alerts; remote monitoring facilitates the early detection of this critical event to resolve the problem faster than the next scheduled follow-up. Remote monitoring can prevent serious damage to the patient and avoids systematic ambulatory control of the ICD after each radiotherapy session."

The ""JArDinS"" quasi-experimental study aimed to assess the impact of community garden participation on the adoption of more sustainable lifestyles among French adults.",None,"Individuals entering a community garden in Montpellier (France) in 2018 (n = 66) were compared with pairwise matched individuals with no experience in community gardening (n = 66). Nutritional quality, environmental impact and cost of monthly household food supplies, level of physical activity measured by accelerometers, as well as mental and social well-being, sensitivity to food waste, and connection with nature were evaluated at baseline (t0) and 12 months later (t1) to explore sustainability of lifestyles in social/health, environmental and economic dimensions. Linear mixed models were used to determine the independent effect of community gardening on investigated lifestyles components. In-depth interviews were conducted at t1 with 15 gardeners to better understand changes that may have occurred in gardeners' lives during the first year of gardening.","At t0, gardeners had lower education level, lower BMI and their household reported lower percentage of meals consumed outside of the home compared to non-gardeners (p <  0.05). Participating in the community garden had no significant impact, in spite of sufficient statistical power, on fruit and vegetables supplies (main outcome), nor on physical activity parameters, nor on others of the social/health, environmental and economic lifestyles components investigated. Qualitative interviews suggested the existence of pre-established health and environmental consciousness in some gardeners and revealed several barriers to the participation such as lack of time, lack of gardening knowledge, physical difficulty of gardening, health problems and conflicts with other gardeners.",The health benefits of community gardening previously reported by cross-sectional studies might be confounded by selection bias. The JArDinS study highlights the need to identify solutions to overcome barriers related to community garden participation when designing relevant public health interventions for the promotion of sustainable lifestyles.

Children do not always have insight on their distress, which can limit the utility of self-reported units of distress (SUDS) during exposures. Physiological assessment provides an objective means of monitoring emotional arousal. Electrodermal activity (EDA) in particular indexes sympathetic nervous system arousal which is heavily linked to anxiety. The aim of the current study was to examine the feasibility and utility of incorporating EDA assessment in an in-session exposure. We examined concordance between EDA and SUDS, and whether either predicted treatment response.",None,"Thirty-four youth who met DSM-5 criteria for generalized, separation, and/or social anxiety disorder completed brief CBT (8 sessions) and completed a survey on trait physiological arousal. EDA and SUDS were collected from 18 youth (9 female, ages 9-14) during a mid-treatment exposure. Changes in anxiety severity were examined post-treatment.","SUDS were not correlated with trait or state physiological arousal. There was a large association between heightened sympathetic arousal and poorer post-treatment response.

Hatha yogic exercises are a form of psychophysical attention-based activity. Research of experiences after participating in an adapted hatha yoga (YE) intervention remains limited. The aim of the present study was to explore the experiences of patients with obstructive pulmonary diseases (asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) in a 12-week hatha yoga intervention (YE).,"Fifteen patients (10 women and 5 men, median age = 61, range: 44-76 years) who had participated in YE were interviewed after the intervention. Interview data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis.","Three main categories emerged: ""To focus and be aware of oneself"", ""To gain new knowledge through practice"" and ""To master one's own situation"". The overall theme ""From limitation to opportunity - to experience breathing as a tool in daily life"" illustrates a learning process on different levels. The participants described improved physical symptoms and breathing techniques, greater energy/stamina and body awareness along with a new sense of control over their breathing in different situations.","Patients with obstructive pulmonary diseases may strengthen their self-awareness and improve control of symptoms and learning new ways of breathing after practicing YE, which may provide a tool to control disease symptoms in daily life.

An exercise test to measure oxygen consumption during submaximal and maximal cycling exercise was completed at the start at and end of each intervention. Anthropometric (DEXA) and blood measures were made prior to and following each intervention period.","Total body mass and percentage body fat did not change significantly (p > 0.05). However, a significantly greater increase in bone-free lean mass (LM) occurred with KER compared to CAS (0.88 kg vs 0.07 kg; p < 0.05). While no change in LM was evident for the trunk and arms, leg LM increased (0.45 ± 0.54 kg; p = 0.006) from baseline with KER. KER was not associated with changes in blood parameters, oxygen consumption, or exercise performance (p > 0.05).",These data suggest that KER is not useful as an ergogenic aid for endurance athletes but may be a suitable protein supplement for maximizing increases in lean body mass.

A particular focus was dedicated to collecting demographic, clinical, radiologic, and outcomes data. All patients had failed medical management.","Of the 110 patients evaluated for IIH, 42 underwent venous sinus stenting, with a mean follow-up of 25.6 months (range, 8.7-60.7 months). The mean age was 32 years (range, 15-52 years), 38 (90%) were women, and the mean body mass index was 35.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (range, 18.6-47.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Prior to the stenting procedure, all patients had headaches, visual disturbances, and papilledema. Of the 39 patients who had an ophthalmologic evaluation poststenting, 29 (74%) had resolution of their papilledema. Eighteen patients (43%) had complete resolution of their headaches after the stenting procedure, whereas 22 patients (52%) remained under a neurologist's care for chronic migraine and other types of headaches. Two patients underwent a restenting procedure for disease progression, and 1 patient experienced an in-stent thrombosis.","A multidisciplinary approach involving neurosurgeons, ophthalmologists, radiologists, and neurologists is integral in the management of patients with IIH to prevent the complications of papilledema.

This study is aimed at determining the effects of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) on the acupuncture points of pain in patients under mechanical ventilators.,"This randomized double-blind clinical trial study was conducted on 50 patients undergoing mechanical ventilation in intensive care units of Imam Reza hospital in Kermanshah, Iran, in 2017. The patients were randomly allocated into intervention and placebo groups. In the intervention group, TENS electrodes were placed on points Hegu and Zusanli. Pain severity was measured using the Care Pain Observation Tool scale, and the dosages of narcotics and sedation intake were recorded. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software, version 19.","The level of pain in patients decreased in the intervention group in comparison with the sham group, and this decline was significant during certain hours (p < 0.05). The amount of analgesic and sedation drugs used was less significant in the intervention group than in the sham group (p = 0.01; p = 0.04).",The results showed that the use of TENS on acupuncture points can decrease the level of pain and opioid consumption in intubated patients under a mechanical ventilator.

Positive nipple margin was defined as any residual invasive carcinoma or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) within the additional nipple margin. Management included complete NAC removal, subareolar shave biopsy, or observation alone. Primary outcomes included rates of positive nipple margin and local recurrence.","A total of 819 breasts underwent NSM, yielding a total of 32 breasts (3.9%) with positive nipple margin. Management included 11 (34.4%) subareolar shave biopsies, 15 (46.9%) complete NAC excisions, and 5 (15.6%) with observation alone, plus 1 (3.1%) lost to follow-up. Final pathology after subareolar shave biopsy did not reveal any residual disease, and no patients developed NAC necrosis or required NAC removal. Final pathology after NAC excision revealed 3 of 15 with additional disease (1 invasive ductal carcinoma, 2 DCIS). Of the five patients who had no subsequent intervention, tumor pathology was DCIS in all cases. One patient received adjuvant radiation therapy. Mean time to intervention was 3.7 ± 1.9 with mean follow-up of 2.9 years.",Management of positive nipple margin after NSM with subareolar shave biopsy is a safe alternative to preserve the NAC.

Whether coping strategies will associate with sub-clinical left ventricular hypertrophy (electrocardiographic-left ventricular hypertrophy [ECG-LVH] or Cornell product), cardiomyocyte injury and blood pressure (BP), is unclear. Therefore, we assessed relationships between ECG-LVH, cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and 24-hour BP in bi-ethnic groups when habitually utilising a certain coping style, and these groups when having a stress-related cTnT cut-point of 4.2ng/L.",None,"A target population study included a Black (n=190) and White (n=204) teachers' gender cohort (20-65years) from South Africa.

Stratification of groups was done for ethnicity and DefS. Blacks sought more social support, used less avoidance coping and presented with higher CVD susceptibility. Hypertension prevalence and ECG-LVH levels in DefS Blacks (63%) were higher compared to DefS Whites (40%). Multivariate regression analyses showed positive associations between Cornell product, cTnT and BP [p≤0.05] in DefS Blacks only. Their 24-hour systolic blood pressure (SBP) was associated with time-domain depressed heart-rate-variability and prolonged ST-segment-depression especially when applying an established stress-related cTnT ≥ 4.2ng/L cut-point.","Defensive coping facilitated autonomic hyperactivity, myocardial injury and subsequent compensatory BP elevations as possible homeostatic reflexes to alleviate myocardial perfusion deficits. The resulting pressure overload increased sub-clinical wall remodelling and ischaemic heart disease risk in Blacks utilising habitual defensiveness. We therefore recommend regular ECG and high sensitivity cTnT screening in asymptomatic patients with emotional stress susceptibility. Longitudinal evidence is needed to confirm causality and progression of cardiomyopathy risk."

A range of inflammation based prognostic scores have been proposed in an attempt to predict outcome. This study evaluated five such prognostic scores in oesophageal and gastric carcinoma patients.,"The modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS), Neutrophil Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), Platelet Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR), Prognostic Index (PI), and Prognostic Nutrition Index (PNI) were calculated for 723 consecutive patients undergoing oesophagectomy or gastrectomy at a single center. The predictive accuracy of each score was assessed using ROC curves and survival analyses.","Overall, only PLR and PNI were significantly predictive of patient survival (both P < 0.001), with no significant association detected for mGPS (P = 0.480), NLR (P = 0.210), or PI (P = 0.808). Subgroup analysis found the predictive accuracy of PNI to be significantly greater in oesophagectomy than gastrectomy patients (hazard ratio 2.75 vs 1.39, P = 0.016) and mGPS to be predictive of patient survival only in oesophagectomies (P < 0.001).",Inflammation based prognostic scores may have a role in patients undergoing resection for oesophageal and gastric cancer. These scores are easily calculable from routinely collected data and could be used as an adjunct to existing staging modalities.

Patients with previous diagnosis and/or treatment of OSA were excluded. Patients underwent 2 consecutive nights of ambulatory sleep testing with full electroencephalogram recording. OSA was defined as an Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) score ≥ 5 per hour of sleep.","123 patients with AF were recruited, with 100 patients included in the final analysis. OSA was detected in 85% of these patients. 27% of patients with normal overall AHI had an increased AHI during rapid eye movement sleep. Only age and male sex were independent predictors of the presence of OSA in these patients.","OSA is common and often undetected in patients with AF, especially in nonobese and/or female patients. Patients may have a normal overall AHI but an abnormal AHI during rapid eye movement sleep. The clinical relevance and therapeutic implications in this subgroup should be further investigated. The clinical features of OSA are not reliable predictors of OSA in patients with AF. A low threshold for detection of OSA, with sleep studies, in these patients may be merited."

Data were analysed against salivary cortisol and maternal diabetes severity and treatment (insulin [N = 22] or metformin [N = 23]) during pregnancy.","GDM-exposed children had reduced cortical excitability (p = .003), LTD-like neuroplasticity (p = .005), and salivary cortisol (p < .001) when compared with control children. Higher maternal insulin resistance (IR) before and during GDM treatment was associated with a blunted neuroplastic response in children (p = .014) and this was not accounted for by maternal BMI. Additional maternal and neonatal measures, including fasting plasma glucose and inflammatory markers, predicted neurophysiological outcomes. The metformin and insulin treatment groups had similar outcomes.","These results suggest that GDM can contribute to subtle differences in child neurophysiology, and possibly cortisol secretion, persisting into early adolescence. Importantly, these effects appear to occur during second trimester, before pharmacologic treatment typically commences, and can be predicted by maternal insulin resistance. Therefore, earlier detection and treatment of GDM may be warranted. Metformin appears to be safe for these aspects of neurodevelopment."

A sedentary lifestyle and a parent who had sustained a hip fracture increased the likelihood of a treatment recommendation by 10% and 12%, respectively. While patients with a spinal fracture were 11% more likely to have received a treatment recommendation, those with a hip fracture were 2% less likely to have received such a recommendation. Age was not strongly associated with the likelihood of receiving a treatment recommendation but was associated with the initiation of treatment.","Practitioners at sites in the Own the Bone program recommend anti-osteoporosis treatment, at the time of initial evaluation, to about three-quarters of patients who present with a fragility fracture. This is a very strong improvement over previously reported national data. The findings that a hip fracture had the lowest association and age had very little association with the likelihood of recommending treatment were unexpected and perhaps deserve further investigation."

An electrocardiogram and rehabilitation outcome scores were obtained at each visit. Qualitative interviews determined the acceptability of taVNS to participants.","Median time after stroke was 1.16 years, and baseline median/interquartile range upper limb Fugl-Meyer (UFM) score was 63 (54.5-99.5). Participants attended 92% of the planned treatment sessions. Three participants reported side effects, mainly fatigue, but all performed mean of more than 300 arm repetitions per session with no serious adverse events. There was a significant change in the UFM score with a mean increase per participant of 17.1 points (standard deviation 7.8).",taVNS is feasible and well-tolerated alongside upper limb repetitive movements in poststroke rehabilitation. The motor improvements observed justify a phase 2 trial in patients with residual arm weakness.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of subgingival GPAP as an additional approach to nonsurgical periodontal treatment in subjects with chronic periodontitis.,"Twenty-seven nonsmoking subjects were recruited. Two quadrants in each subject were randomly assigned, according to a split-mouth design, to receive scaling and root planing (SRP) and GPAP (Test group) or SRP and air flushing with water (Control group) at sites with probing depth ≥5 mm. Clinical parameters, gingival crevicular fluid volumes and the concentrations of interleukin-1β and interleukin-1ra in gingival crevicular fluid were measured at baseline and 1, 3 and 6 months after the treatments.","At baseline, no statistically significant difference in periodontal and gingival crevicular fluid parameters was found between the Test and Control groups. Overall, the periodontal conditions of all subjects showed significant improvement after the treatments. Notably, the Test group showed greater reduction in gingival crevicular fluid volume (0.37 ± 0.26 μL) than the Control group (0.23 ± 0.30 μL) at 3 months (P < .05). The gingival crevicular fluid levels of interleukin-1β and interleukin-1ra showed a significant decrease in both groups at 6 months, and no significant difference was found between the groups.","These preliminary results suggest that GPAP, as an additional approach to nonsurgical periodontal treatment, may be beneficial for the short-term improvement of subclinical inflammation when measured by gingival crevicular fluid volume. Further longitudinal studies with larger sample sizes are required to clarify the exact benefits of GPAP treatment for controlling inflammation and maintaining long-term periodontal health."

TDR may reduce this risk.,The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of progression in radiographic adjacent-level degeneration (ΔALD) from preoperative assessment to 5 years after total disc replacement (TDR) and the relationship of these changes with range of motion and clinical adjacent-level disease. A secondary objective was to compare adjacent-level degeneration (ALD) outcomes between TDR and fusion.,"Post-hoc analysis of 5-year follow-up data from a randomized, multicenter trial.","At 5-year follow-up, 9.7% (17/175) of TDR patients had ΔALD at the superior level. In patients with preoperative ALD at the superior level, most (88% [23/26]) showed no radiographic progression over 5 years. The rate of clinical ALD was 2.3% (4/175) and none of these patients had ALD at baseline. For each degree of range of motion gained at the TDR level, there was a consistent decrease in the percentage of patients with ΔALD. After matching and adjustment of baseline characteristics, TDR had a significantly lower likelihood of ΔALD than fusion (odds ratio 0.32; 95% confidence interval 0.13, 0.76).",The rates of ΔALD and clinical ALD in this TDR population were similar to those previously reported in the literature for TDR at 5-year follow-up. TDR had a significantly lower rate of ΔALD than fusion.

Reports concluded that both treatments were moderately effective, each leading to recovery in over a fifth of patients. However, the reported analyses did not consistently follow the procedures set out in the published protocol, and it is unclear whether the conclusions are fully justified by the evidence.",None,"Here, we present results based on the original protocol-specified procedures. Data from a recent Freedom of Information request enabled us to closely approximate these procedures. We also evaluate the conclusions from the trial as a whole.","On the original protocol-specified primary outcome measure - overall improvement rates - there was a significant effect of treatment group. However, the groups receiving CBT or GET did not significantly outperform the Control group after correcting for the number of comparisons specified in the trial protocol. Also, rates of recovery were consistently low and not significantly different across treatment groups. Finally, on secondary measures, significant effects were almost entirely confined to self-report measures. These effects did not endure beyond two years.",These findings raise serious concerns about the robustness of the claims made about the efficacy of CBT and GET. The modest treatment effects obtained on self-report measures in the PACE trial do not exceed what could be reasonably accounted for by participant reporting biases.

Nine patients showed a Q variation with dobutamine infusion calculated by both classical and alternative methods ≥ |15|% and were selected for further statistical analysis. Using the Bland-Altman method to assess agreement we found a systematic bias of 0,037 cm2 (95% CI 0,004 - 0,066), meaning that on average the new method overestimates the EOAproj in 0,037 cm2 compared to the original method. The 95% limits of agreement are narrow (from -0,04 cm2 to 0,12 cm2), meaning that for 95% of individuals, EOAproj calculated by the new method would be between 0,04 cm2 less to 0,12 cm2 more than the EOAproj calculated by the original equation.","The bias and 95% limits of agreement of the new method are narrow and not clinically relevant, supporting the potential interchangeability of the two methods of EOAproj calculation. As the new method requires less additional measurements, it would be easier to implement in clinical practice, promoting an increase in the use of EOAproj."

We hypothesized that the use of a long-arm cylinder made of soft cast material will result in similar outcomes to those obtained with a traditional long-arm hard cast.,None,"We randomly assigned 100 consecutive children who presented with a closed, nondisplaced, type I supracondylar humeral fracture or an occult, closed, acute elbow injury, to 1 of 2 groups: group A (n=50) received a long-arm, traditional fiberglass (hard) cast. Group B (n=50) received a long-arm, soft fiberglass cast. After 4 weeks, the cast was removed in group A by a member of our staff using a cast saw, and in group B by one of the patient's parents by rolling back the soft fiberglass material. We compared the amount of fracture displacement and/or angulation, recovery of range of motion, elbow pain, and patient satisfaction.","There were no instances of unplanned removal of the cast by the patient or parent. No evidence of fracture displacement or angulation was seen in either group. The final carrying angle of the affected elbow was nearly identical of that of the normal, contralateral elbow in both groups (P=0.64). At the latest follow-up appointment, elbows in groups A and B had a similar mean arc of motion (156 vs. 154 degrees; P=0.45), and had achieved identical relative arc of motion of 99.6% and 99.5% of that of the normal, contralateral side, respectively (P=0.94). Main pain scores were low and comparable over the study period. All patients in both groups reported the highest rate of satisfaction at the eighth week of follow-up.","The results indicate that children with nondisplaced supracondylar humeral fractures can be successfully managed with the use of a removable long-arm soft cast, maintaining fracture alignment and resulting in comparable rates of range of motion, pain, and patient satisfaction. The use of a removable immobilization that can reliably maintain fracture alignment and result in similar outcomes, while minimizing the risk of noncompliance, could be advantageous. Although we elected to remove the soft cast during a scheduled follow-up, it appears that such immobilization could be removed easily and safely at home, potentially resulting in a lower number of patient visits, decreased health care costs, and higher patient/parent satisfaction."

After adjusting for age, race, gender, insurance, comorbidities, perioperative factors, and reason for readmission, nonindex readmission for patients undergoing their initial operation at a teaching hospital did not impact mortality (odds ratio [OR] 0.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.28-2.17, P = 0.63). Nonindex readmission for patients undergoing their initial operation at a nonteaching hospital, however, significantly increased mortality (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.04-2.54, P = 0.03).","Readmission to a different hospital is associated with a higher mortality rate for patients undergoing AAA repair at nonteaching hospitals. This effect is not seen in patients having their initial operation performed at teaching hospitals, possibly due to infrastructure at these hospitals allowing for decreased impact from fragmentation of care.

Frequency distributions and summary measures, as well as univariate analysis were performed for all the variables in consideration. The annual parasite index (API) was calculated.","Data on 214 cases were obtained from the surveillance system. A majority of the cases were reported in men (63.1%), followed by in children < 15 years (23.8%), and were caused predominantly by Plasmodium vivax (86.0%), with most of the infection occurring in the urban areas (52.8%) of Pereira. The API, by sex and age group, was higher among men ≥ 80 years. The outbreak study reported 14 cases of malaria in rural/peri-urban neighborhoods, and it was observed that the anopheline breeding sites were in close proximity to the houses in these areas. This population did not use protective measures against mosquitoes and chemical control was conducted through residual and spatial insecticide spraying.","This study suggested the presence of autochthonous malaria transmission, in Pereira, between 2008 and 2015, most of which were cases of P. vivax. A greater intensity was observed between 2008 and 2009 when malaria was possibly reintroduced to the region. During the years of the study, a gradual decrease in the number of reported cases of malaria was observed in Pereira, except for the time period between 2008 and 2009 when a spike was noted (estimated using the API); this was most likely caused by an outbreak. Interventions that are more aggressive in nature are required to prevent further malarial transmission and dissemination."

It has been suggested that spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) may exert anti-inflammatory effects.,The purpose of this study was to determine the involvement of inflammation-associated chemokines (CC series) in the pathogenesis of nonspecific LBP and to evaluate the effect of SMT on that process.,"Patients presenting with nonradicular, nonspecific LBP (minimum pain score 3 on 10-point visual analog scale) were recruited according to stringent inclusion criteria. They were evaluated for appropriateness to treat using a high velocity low amplitude manipulative thrust in the lumbar-lumbosacral region. Blood samples were obtained at baseline and following the administration of a series of 6 high velocity low amplitude manipulative thrusts on alternate days over the period of 2 weeks. The in vitro levels of CC chemokine ligands (CCL2, CCL3, and CCL4) production and plasma levels of an inflammatory biomarker, soluble E-selectin (sE-selectin), were determined at baseline and at the termination of treatments 2 weeks later.","Compared with asymptomatic controls baseline production of all chemokines was significantly elevated in acute (P=0.004 to <0.0001), and that of CCL2 and CCL4 in chronic LBP patients (P<0.0001). Furthermore, CCL4 production was significantly higher (P<0.0001) in the acute versus chronic LBP group. sE-selectin levels were significantly higher (P=0.003) in chronic but not in acute LBP patients. Following SMT, patient-reported outcomes showed significant (P<0.0001) improvements in visual analog scale and Oswestry Disability Index scores. This was accompanied by a significant decline in CCL3 production (P<0.0001) in both groups of patients. Change scores for CCL4 production differed significantly (P<0.0001) only for the acute LBP cohort, and no effect on the production of CCL2 or plasma sE-selectin levels was noted in either group.","The production of chemotactic cytokines is significantly and protractedly elevated in LBP patients. Changes in chemokine production levels, which might be related to SMT, differ in the acute and chronic LBP patient cohorts."

We aimed to identify time course predictors of in-hospital mortality and to establish a sequentially assessable risk model.,None,None,"We enrolled 1,035 consecutive AHF patients into derivation (n = 597) and validation (n = 438) cohorts. For risk assessments at admission, we utilized Get With the Guidelines-Heart Failure (GWTG-HF) risk scores. We examined significant predictors of in-hospital mortality from 11 variables obtained during hospitalization and developed a risk stratification model using multiple logistic regression analysis. Across both cohorts, 86 patients (8.3%) died during hospitalization. Using backward stepwise selection, we identified five time-course predictors: catecholamine administration, minimum platelet concentration, maximum blood urea nitrogen, total bilirubin, and C-reactive protein levels; and established a time course risk score that could sequentially assess a patient's risk status. The addition of a time course risk score improved the discriminative ability of the GWTG-HF risk score (c-statistics in derivation and validation cohorts: 0.776 to 0.888 [p = 0.002] and 0.806 to 0.902 [p<0.001], respectively).

Although computed tomography (CT) has an important role in evaluating the severity of diverticulitis, its findings alone may not predict the need for emergent surgical intervention in all patients with acute diverticulitis in the ED. Serum inflammation markers may help to differentiate severity of acute diverticulitis and predict the need for surgical intervention in clinical practice. No information is currently available on the clinical usefulness of the delta neutrophil index (DNI), with respect to the prediction of emergent surgical intervention in patients with acute diverticulitis at the ED.",None,"This was a retrospective observational study of consecutive adult patients with acute diverticulitis confirmed by CT in the ED, between January 2014 and December 2016. Recruited patients were divided into two groups: emergent surgical intervention and no surgical intervention. The following laboratory serum parameters were examined in the ED: DNI value, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, white blood cell count, neutrophil count, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). The patients were also examined for the presence or absence of complications by CT.","A total of 132 patients were finally included in the study, with the emergent surgical intervention group constituting 52 patients. The median DNI value, CRP levels, neutrophil count, and NLR were significantly higher in the emergent surgical intervention group than in the no surgical intervention group. The area under the curve for predicting emergent surgical intervention, using the DNI was significantly higher than that of CRP levels, neutrophil count, or NLR. Moreover, the combination of initial DNI and CT was most powerful diagnostic modality.","DNI values measured at the ED combined with CT were good predictors for emergent surgical intervention in acute diverticulitis. If the DNI value is greater than 0.7% and complications in CT are suspected in patients suspected to have acute diverticulitis, the need for emergent surgical intervention should be considered carefully in the ED."

We correlated the findings of MRI with those seen on hip arthroscopy in children with active stage of LCPD.,None,"We conducted a prospective observational study in which MRI findings were correlated with corresponding findings on hip arthroscopy in a cohort of 25 patients of active LCPD below 12 years of age. The parameters noted on MRI included status of ligamentum teres, status of the labrum, synovial effusion if any, condition of the femoral and acetabular articular cartilage including chondral flaps, chondral indentation and intra-articular loose bodies. The indication of performing hip arthroscopy was persistent severe hip pain (Wong-Baker FACES pain scale ≥ 3) after 6 months of conservative management. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated for MRI considering arthroscopy as a gold standard.","Synovial effusion was seen in a large number of patients on both MRI (17) and hip arthroscopy (24). The sensitivity (95% confidence interval) of MRI was found to be low, especially with respect to labral tears [25% (0.63-80.6)] and intra-articular loose bodies [20% (0.51-71.6)]. NPV for synovial effusion was also found to be low [12.5% (0.32-52.7)], although specificity and PPV of MRI were found to be good for all the parameters.","MRI cannot be completely relied upon for identifying all the intra-articular pathologies in children with LCPD, although it has a good complimentary role.

Each stratum was then block randomized to receive multimodal anti-HE intervention (lactulose+branched-chain amino acids+rifaximin) or triple placebos for 3 months in a double-blinded fashion. The CRT is a simple PC-based test and the test result, the CRT index (normal threshold > 1.9), describes the patient's stability of alertness during the 10-minute test. Our study outcome was the change in CRT index in each group at study exit. The portosystemic encephalopathy (PSE) test, a paper-and-pencil test battery (normal threshold above -5), was used as a comparator test according to international guidelines.","The patients with an abnormal CRT index who were randomized to receive the active intervention normalized or improved their CRT index (mean change 0.92 ± 0.29, p = 0.01). Additionally, their PSE improved (change 3.85 ± 1.83, p = 0.03).

While there is no data evaluating ondansetron's efficacy for preventing opioid-induced nausea and vomiting, this practice remains common despite a lack of supporting evidence.",This study aimed to identify if prophylactic ondansetron administered with intravenous (IV) opioids prevents opioid-induced nausea or vomiting.,"This prospective observational study was conducted in the ED at two academic medical institutions. Patients were eligible for enrollment if they were prescribed an IV opioid with or without IV ondansetron and absence of baseline nausea. Patients' level of nausea was evaluated at baseline, 5 min, and 30 min after an IV opioid was administered and then observed for 2 hours.","One hundred thirty-three patients were enrolled, with 90% of patients presenting with a chief complaint of pain. Sixty-four (48.1%) patients received an IV opioid alone and 69 (51.9%) patients received both IV ondansetron and an IV opioid. Twenty-three (17.3%) patients developed nausea caused by opioid administration. One (0.75%) patient had an emetic event and 3 (2.3%) patients required rescue antiemetics during their observation period. Rate of nausea was similar between treatment groups 5 min after the opioid was administered (p = 0.153).

Near infrared-based optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a novel imaging technique that combined with bronchoscopy generates highly detailed images of the airway wall. The aim of this study is to identify and quantify human airway wall layers both ex-vivo and in-vivo by OCT and correlate these to histology.,None,"Patients with lung cancer, prior to lobectomy, underwent bronchoscopy including in-vivo OCT imaging. Ex-vivo OCT imaging was performed in the resected lung lobe after needle insertion for matching with histology. Airway wall layer perimeters and their corresponding areas were assessed by two independent observers. Airway wall layer areas (total wall area, mucosal layer area and submucosal muscular layer area) were calculated.","13 airways of 5 patients were imaged by OCT. Histology was matched with 51 ex-vivo OCT images and 39 in-vivo OCT images. A significant correlation was found between ex-vivo OCT imaging and histology, in-vivo OCT imaging and histology and ex-vivo OCT imaging and in-vivo OCT imaging for all measurements (p < 0.0001 all comparisons). A minimal bias was seen in Bland-Altman analysis. High inter-observer reproducibility with intra-class correlation coefficients all above 0.90 were detected.",OCT is an accurate and reproducible imaging technique for identification and quantification of airway wall layers and can be considered as a promising minimal-invasive imaging technique to identify and quantify airway remodeling in obstructive lung diseases.

The intervention group (IG, n = 51) underwent a motor learning exercise program on compensatory STS maneuvers specifically designed for PwD. The control group (CG, n = 46) performed a low-intensity motor placebo activity. Primary outcomes were scores of the Assessment of Compensatory Sit-to-stand Maneuvers in People with Dementia (ACSID), which covers the number of recalled and initiated, and of effectively performed compensatory STS maneuvers. Secondary outcomes included temporal and kinematic STS characteristics measured by a body-fixed motion sensor (BFS, DynaPort® Hybrid).",The IG significantly improved in all ACSID scores compared to the CG (p < 0.001).

This model is a proven teaching tool for medical students, but its effect on resident learning is less established. We hypothesized that repetition of key clinical concepts in a ""Clinical Pearls"" format would improve knowledge retention in medical residents.",None,"This study investigated spaced education with particular emphasis on using a novel, email-based reinforcement program, and a randomized, self-matched design, in which residents were quizzed on medical knowledge that was either reinforced or not with electronically-administered spaced education. Both reinforced and non-reinforced knowledge was later tested with four quizzes.","Overall, respondents incorrectly answered 395 of 1008 questions (0.39; 95% CI, 0.36-0.42).

Although there was no evidence of benefit among residents (RR = 1.01; 95% CI, 0.83-1.22; p = 0.95), we observed a significantly lower risk of incorrect responses to reinforced material among interns (RR = 0.83, 95% CI, 0.70-0.99, p = 0.04).","Overall, repetition of Clinical Pearls did not statistically improve test scores amongst junior and senior residents. However, among interns, repetition of the Clinical Pearls was associated with significantly higher test scores, perhaps reflecting their greater attendance at didactic sessions and engagement with Clinical Pearls. Although the study was limited by a low response rate, we employed test and control questions within the same quiz, limiting the potential for selection bias. Further work is needed to determine the optimal spacing and content load of Clinical Pearls to maximize retention amongst medical residents. This particular protocol of spaced education, however, was unique and readily reproducible suggesting its potential efficacy for intern education within a large residency program."

Baseline bone biopsies were retrieved from the implant sites. After 60 and 90 days, the pain score, implant stability quotient (ISQ), and peri-implant crevicular fluid (PICF) gene expression were analyzed. Furthermore, radiological and clinical assessments were made at 90 days.","At 90 days, no pain was reported, irrespective of smoking habit. A higher ISQ was found in smokers compared with non-smokers. Marginal bone loss (MBL) was greater in smokers than in non-smokers. The comparison of implant surfaces revealed greater MBL exclusively at the machined implants in smokers. At 90 days in smokers, the PICF around machined implants revealed a higher expression of the proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and a lower expression of the osteogenic gene, osteocalcin (OC), compared with the PICF around modified implants. Furthermore, OC expression was lower at machined implants in smokers compared with machined implants in non-smokers. After adjustment for age and implant location (maxilla/mandible), multivariate regression revealed the following predictors of MBL: smoking, bleeding on probing at 90 days, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) expression at baseline and IL-6 expression in PICF at 90 days.","During the early phase of osseointegration, non-smokers and smokers present a similar, high implant survival. In contrast, smokers present a greater MBL, particularly at machined implants. HIF-1α baseline expression in the recipient bone and IL-6 expression in PICF cells are important molecular determinants for MBL after 90 days. It is concluded that smoking has an early effect on osseointegration, which is dependent on the implant surface properties and the local host response."

The association of clinicopathologic characteristics with local relapse-free survival (LRFS) and OS was analyzed. Univariate analysis was performed to determine whether tumor characteristics and types of therapy affected prognosis, and a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model was developed to further investigate local recurrence and mortality.","Mean follow-up time was 50 months. The cumulative 5- and 10-year LRFS was 35 and 0%, respectively, while the cumulative 5- and 10-year OS was 69 and 53%, respectively. The univariate analysis identified contiguous segments involved, intralesional surgical margin at primary surgery, primary surgery in local hospital, incisional biopsy, and without adjuvant radiotherapy as negative prognostic factors for LRFS, whereas for OS, only tumor location in the upper cervical spine was statistically significant. In the multivariate analysis, contiguous vertebral segments involved, intralesional surgical margins, and incisional biopsy were identified as negative prognostic factors for LRFS, whereas for OS, again only tumor location in the upper cervical spine was statistically significant.","Contiguous vertebral segments involved, intralesional surgical margin, without adjuvant radiotherapy, and incisional biopsy significantly increase local recurrence, while tumor location in the upper cervical spine significantly increases tumor-related mortality. Thus, computed tomography-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy and total spondylectomy with marginal excision may improve survival of patients with cervical chordoma."

Navigation services included symptom management, education, advance care planning, advocacy, mobilization of resources, and psychosocial support. The nurse navigator collected longitudinal data on older adult and family needs, and older adult quality of life and healthcare utilization.","Satisfaction with the service was high. There was no attrition over the 2-year period except through death, and few cancelled visits, indicating a high degree of acceptability of the intervention. The navigator addressed complex, multi-faceted needs through connecting health, social, and informal community resources. Participants who indicated a preferred place of death were able to die in that preferred place (n = 7). Emergency room use by participants was minimal and largely unpreventable by the nurse navigator. Longitudinal health-related quality of life scores for many participants were poor, lending further support to the need for more focused attention to this upstream palliative population.",Using a nurse navigator to facilitate early palliative care for rural older adults living with advanced chronic illness is a promising innovation for meeting the needs of this population. Further research is required to evaluate outcomes on a larger scale.

All participants were instructed to sleep within one hour of their self-reported average sleep schedule for the last four days of the study break. We analyzed the participants' wrist actigraphy data during these four days to examine intraindividual variability in sleep timing, duration and efficiency. We also examined shifts in the DLMO from before and after the study break.",None,"Under the same conditions, people with DSWPD had significantly more variable wake times and total sleep time than healthy controls (p ≤ 0.015). Intraindividual variability in sleep onset time and sleep efficiency was similar between the two groups (p ≥ 0.30). The DLMO was relatively stable across the study break, with only 11% of controls but 27% of DSWPDs showed more than a one hour shift in the DLMO. Only in the DSWPD sample was greater sleep variability associated with a larger shift in the DLMO (r = 0.46, p = 0.03). These results suggest that intraindividual variability in sleep can be higher in DSWPD versus healthy controls, and this may impact variability in the DLMO. DSWPD patients with higher intraindividual variability in sleep are more likely to have a shifting DLMO, which could impact sleep symptoms and the optimal timing of light and/or melatonin treatment for DSWPD."

In conclusion, we recommend 3-h clamping after TKA as the optimal release time to reduce blood loss and acute phase pain."

Their development often takes several years and may rely on chronic virus exposure. At the same time recent studies show that treatment early in infection may provide opportunities for immune preservation. However, it is unknown how intermittent treatment in early infection affects development of the humoral immune response over time. We investigate the effect of cART in early HIV infection on the properties of the memory B cell compartment following 6 months of cART or in the absence of treatment. The patients included participated in the Primo-SHM trial where patients with an early HIV-1 infection were randomized to no treatment or treatment for 24 or 60 weeks.",None,Primo-SHM trial patients selected for the present study were untreated (n = 23) or treated for 24 weeks (n = 24).

In contrast to untreated patients, in treated patients the humoral HIV-specific response reached a set point over time. At a transcriptional level, sets of genes that showed enhanced expression in memory B cells at viral setpoint in untreated patients, conversely showed rapid increase of expression of the same genes in treated patients at the late time point.","These data suggest that, although the memory B cell compartment is phenotypically preserved until viral setpoint after treatment interruption, the development of the HIV-specific antibody response may benefit from exposure to HIV. The effect of viral exposure on B cell properties is also reflected by longitudinal changes in transcriptional profile in memory B cells over time in early treated patients."

Similar analyses with IGA ratings of Clear or Almost Clear were performed.,Significantly more PASI 90-100 responders at week 12 had DLQI 0/1 response than PASI 75-89 (69.4% vs. 47.1%; p < .001) and sustained DLQI 0/1 response at week 52 (74.0% vs. 56.7%; p < .001). IGA results were similar.,These results show that PASI 90-100 is a relevant therapeutic goal in moderate to severe psoriasis compared to PASI 75-89 when considering patients' QOL.
