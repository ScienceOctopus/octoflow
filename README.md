# Octopus: eLife sprint 2021
This repository is for participants of the eLife spring 2021 to play around!



Our aim is to extract the Research Problem statement from scientific research papers, and to hierarchically cluster them by topic such that they form a branching chain with the most general problems at the top, and the most specific at the bottom.



Our main tasks:

1. Identify and pull out sentences from papers (across all fields of STEM) that identify the/a Research Problem
2. Collate/cluster those (are any papers addressing the same Problem?)
3. Create a hierarchy of those Problems – linking them all to one another such that the most general ones are at the top (e.g. ‘diagnosing and curing breast cancer’) with more specific Problems linked further down (e.g. ‘the best chemotherapy regimes for triple negative breast cancer patients’).
4. We probably also need to be able to email the authors of papers from which Problems have been extracted and give them the option to improve the classification of their work, in terms of what the Problem is, and how that Problem relates to other Problems, hierarchically.
