# Octopus 



This will be a one-off task, just to create an initial backbone (!) for Octopus. But it’s a challenge. We need to:



1. Identify and pull out sentences from papers (across all fields of STEM) that identify the/a Research Problem
2. Collate/cluster those (are any papers addressing the same Problem?)
3. Create a hierarchy of those Problems – linking them all to one another such that the most general ones are at the top (e.g. ‘diagnosing and curing breast cancer’) with more specific Problems linked further down (e.g. ‘the best chemotherapy regimes for triple negative breast cancer patients’).
4. We probably also need to be able to email the authors of papers from which Problems have been extracted and give them the option to improve the classification of their work, in terms of what the Problem is, and how that Problem relates to other Problems, hierarchically.
