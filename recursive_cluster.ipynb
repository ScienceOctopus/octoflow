Research from outside of medicine on group trust has not focused on trust in group decisions, and \"group trust\" has not been clearly defined. The purpose was twofold: to examine the definition of trust in the context of group decisions and to explore what factors may influence trust from the perspective of those who rely on competency committees through a proposed group trust model. Methods: The authors conducted a literature search of four online databases, seeking articles published on trust in group settings. Reviewers extracted, coded, and analyzed key data including definitions of trust and factors pertaining to group trust. Results: The authors selected 42 articles for full text review. Although reviewers found multiple general definitions of trust, they were unable to find a clear definition of group trust and propose the following: a group-directed willingness to accept vulnerability to actions of the members based on the expectation that members will perform a particular action important to the group, encompassing social exchange, collective perceptions, and interpersonal trust. Additionally, the authors propose a model encompassing individual level factors (trustor and trustee), interpersonal interactions, group level factors (structure and processes), and environmental factors.\"\"\"\n",

      "The main drawback of these systems is that they fail to recognize terms which are not included in the dictionary.An obvious drawback is that it is necessary to re-classify many words if the application domain changes significantly.Its disadvantage is that sense disambiguation is not carried out relative to any well defined set of senses , but rather an ad hoc set.As also suggested in ( Pradhan et al. , 2008 ) , the major drawback is the poor generalization power affecting lexical features.Another limitation is that taxonomies are built according to the sense distinctions present in dictionaries and not according to the actual use of words in the corpus.A drawback is that their method limits the training of multi-sense embeddings to the M most common words , forcing a complete re-training of the model should a new word of interest appear.One obstacle is that we do not currently use subcategorization dictionaries for either language , while we have several for English.The disadvantage is that many synonyms need to be discarded in order to achieve this property.Another drawback to using an existing external gold standard such as COMLEX to evaluate an automatically induced subcategorization lexicon is that the resources are not necessarily constructed from the same source data.The main drawback with these approaches lies in the WordNet structure itself , where frequently two semantically similar senses are distant in the WordNet hierarchy.A major drawback is the low coverage of the lexicon.Its major drawback is the low number of paraphrases.The main drawback of using CLWSD to evaluate lexical choice is that CLWSD is a lexical sample task , which only evaluates disambiguation of 20 English nouns.A potential drawback of this approach is that it depends heavily on the existence of dictionaries , however these are not always available for any domain and language or if they exist , their coverage is very scarce .\n",

      "To overcome the disadvantage of measure word generation in a general SMT system.Its most obvious drawback is that the method can translate only those source language strings contained in the translation database.In exchange , a limitation of our pre-editing approach is that it is language-dependent , as the underlying technology is based on shallow analysis and is therefore timeexpensive to extend to a new language.A large drawback of SMT systems is that they use no or little grammatical knowledge , relying mainly on a target language model for producing correct target language texts , often resulting in ungrammatical output.A major problem with machine translation , regardless of the translation method , is that performance drops rapidly as input sentences become longer.In our setup , the one possible shortcoming of our approach to constructing reference sets for translation sense clustering is that a cluster may correspond to a sense that is not shared by the original source word used to generate the translation set.The major limitation of these works is the use of EUROVOC , which is a specific resource workable only for European languages.However , a significant drawback of this approach is that PEM requires substantial in-domain bilingual data to train the semantic adequacy evaluator , as well as sample human judgments to train the overall metric.A well-known problem of Statistical Machine Translation ( SMT ) is that performance quickly degrades as soon as testing conditions deviate from training conditions.Compared with the traditional approaches which utilize the first pass translation hypotheses , cross-lingual data selection model avoids the problem of noisy proliferation.A further difficulty is that languages are named , without the corresponding ISO language codes.The evaluation was done on an English-French parallel corpus but is confronted with the important limitation of having only one valid translation ( the aligned translation in the parallel corpus ) as a gold standard translation.However , this method has the major drawback of needing to build a new phrase table for each document to translate\n",

      "However , the problem is not totally solved because many verb reorderings are still missed.The main problem of non-lexicalized context-free grammars is that nonterminal symbols encode too general information which weakly discriminates syntactic ambiguities.The limitation of locating parts of arguments , such as the positions and head words , is that it is only a partial solution to argument labeling in discourse parsing.While these models are well suited for the effective handling of highly divergent sentential word orders , the above frameworks have a limitation shared with probabilistic context free grammars that the preferred ordering of subtrees is insufficiently constrained by their embedding context.One limitation of using the CLE algorithm for generation is that the resulting tree , though maximal in probability , may not conform to basic linguistic properties of a dependency tree.The main difficulty with the model is that because constraints on pronominal anaphora are stated entirely in terms of configurational relations of tree geometry , specifically , in terms of c-command and minimal dominating S and NP domains , control and unbounded dependency structures can only be handled by additional and fairly complex devices.Nevertheless , this approach has a drawback of over-generating ungrammatical sentences due to its “almost-free” alignment.A drawback of our method is that it increases the size of the synchronous context-free grammar massively.However , a fundamental problem with this system is that it does not guarantee that the output parse is a projective dependency tree , only a projective dependency forest , that is , a sequence of adjacent , non-overlapping projective trees ( Nivre 2008 ).However , this approach has several practical limitations : ( 1 ) it does not consider the problem of argument identification of SRL systems , treating arguments as already given ; ( 2 ) it generates rules for the argument classification step preferably from manually annotated data ; ( 3 ) it has been demonstrated for a single language ( French ) , and was not applied to any other language.The problem is that the non-contiguous elements in a verbchain are assigned into a single node while the subject in between belongs to its own node.The other problem is that the parse trees of original and compressed sentences sometimes do not correspond\n",

One of the prominent features of the melancholic symptoms is that patients have the feeling of irrevocability ..The problem with this approach is that the results of such assumptions often lead to conclusions about the production and control of movement that do not relate to the control demands placed on the central nervous system ..A problem with any study in the waking and alert human is that the subject may not be able to completely ignore stimuli , in spite of instructions to do so ..A potential problem with this view is that there exists unambiguous data against the notion that conditioned stimuli ( CSs ) are neutral prior to conditioning ..The problem with such accounts of responsibility , however , is that they fail to specify a neurobiological realization of such mechanisms of control ..Many differences exist , of course , between the behavior of humans and nonhumans-humans , for example , can not fly under their own power-but have we really isolated differences in principle , differences that require separate organizations for the study of each ?
