  &#39;abstract&#39;: &#39;The reaction of the plasma sheet in response to an increase in magnetospheric convection is examined using a combination of energetic neutral atom (ENA) imaging and in situ observations. Data from the IMAGE/MENA instrument are examined in conjunction with observations from the magnetospheric plasma analyzer (MPA) instrument onboard the Los Alamos 1994-084 satellite located in geosynchronous orbit. Examination of the MENA data during an enhanced convection event reveal that between 12:00 and 14:30 UT on 26 June 2001, ENA emissions from the plasma sheet material are observed to strengthen and move Earthwards. A simple calculation of the motion of the peak in ENA emissions following an increase in the convection gives an averaged speed of this sunward surge of around 8 km s−1 between 12:00 and 14:30 UT&#39;,

<pre>&#39;this article discuss some of the merit and demerit of the single - payer model of health care financing , with particular reference to the English National Health Service ( NHS ) . specifically , it be argue that the main merit be that the model can directly provide universal health care coverage , thus eradicate or at least alleviate market failure and equity concern , and that it can achieve this with relatively low total health care expenditure in general and — as compare to the commercial multiple insurance model — low administrative cost in particular . a perceive demerit of the single - payer model be that it can lead to excessive health care rationing , particularly in term of waiting time , although it be argue here that long wait be probably cause by insufficient funding rather than by the single - payer model per se . moreover , rationing of one form or another occur in all health care system , and single - payer model may be the good option if the aim be to incorporate structured ration such that an entire population be subject to the same rule and be thus treat equitably . a far perceive disadvantage of the single - payer model be that it offer limited choice , which be necessarily true with respect to choice of insurer , but choice of provider can be , and increasingly be , a feature of centrally tax - finance health care system . no model of health care funding be perfect ; trade - off be inevitable . whether the merit of the single - payer model be judge to outweigh the demerit will typically vary both across country at any point in time and within a country over time&#39;</pre>
